# The-Mood-of-the-Silver-Economy

We held focus groups with UK senior citizens in 2021, and we analyzed the data derived from them from the perspective of affective computing. We have trained a machine learning classifier capable of distinguishing moods commonly associated with older adults. We have identified depression, sadness and anger as the most prominent mood states conveyed in our focus groups. Our practical insights can aid the design of strategic choices concerning the wellbeing of the ageing population
