0,Speaker 1,F,00:04:38,"Well, this. Well, you don't want any meal kit now."
1,Speaker 2,F,00:04:46,"You want your independence. Yeah, yeah. So it's been kind of a bit of freedom as well. You know, you've worked all your life lived all your life independently and then to get somebody else to be telling you what you should be doing. Yeah. You know, while you can still do it yourself, you understand?"
2,Speaker 3,F,00:05:04,Having your kids do it on the phone.
3,Speaker 1,F,00:05:06,"Oh yeah. I don't want to be sat in a chair then, and old people just want when it's time."
4,Speaker 4,F,00:05:27,"I think if you live in a home and you really become institutionalised, you know, I I mean, I know many people that have moved to the home and they were they were finaly independent in their own home, but they've completely changed when they go into their homes. That's one reason why I want to stay in my own home."
5,Speaker 1,F,00:05:49,"And, you know, people could stay longer independently in their own home, but still might need a bit of support, like a bit of a care package, somebody coming in, maybe just to check on them, not necessarily to do something for them, but just to check their all right. And they've taken the medication, you know, and that helps them stay longer. They don't actually want somebody in there."
6,Speaker 1,F,00:06:20,"But that's that can be quite spooky as well, because I've worked with people with dementia and they put in place different needs to keep them safe at home, like. They they made a recording of their daughter's voice, prompting them to take their medication. Yeah, and it's like that. Well, that can be spooky. If you've got dementia you suddenly got your daughter talking at 10 o'clock at night. Yeah. You she then spent the next few hours looking for her."
7,Speaker 2,F,00:06:49,"No. You know, there was like sensor pads in the bed. But if you set it for eight o'clock in the morning and if you weren't at that bed by 8:30, you get a prompt for what we would like laying but  you know. That type of thing, we have physically seen where voice is coming from. I think here is as an adverse effect on a lot of people."
8,Speaker 3,F,00:07:15,"I've found too. My aunt's got dementia and I was talking to her on the phone when she was still answering the phone and she'd be going on about these people cooking all these lovely meals and then drinking my wine, she said. I've paid for it. They never offered me any and I never get the meal. I was really surprised about this because she got a carer and I wasn't too sure of. And then it tweaked I said: have you got and it was John and Lisa on cooking on a Saturday morning on the television, and she said the television was was real. It took me a while to dig in because she is..."
9,Speaker 4,F,00:08:06,"Did you say, Jill, that she had dementia?"
10,Speaker 3,F,00:08:09,"Yes, she said she got diagnosed"
11,Speaker 4,F,00:08:11,"with Alzheimer's dementia, it's very very difficult. You have to worry about a robot."
12,Speaker 5,F,00:08:30,"we deviate until she's got a brain. So much, much harder. Yes. Yes. So this is not what we are."
13,Speaker 5,F,00:08:55,Walking. Going outside and walking everyday you have to do.
14,Speaker 4,F,00:09:04,"Yeah, yeah, we do. When you took it, you did. Four of us here do Taichi, dancing."
15,Speaker 4,F,00:09:16,"I thought we'd been on hold. Yeah. Yeah. If we're walking for health today,"
16,Speaker 4,F,00:09:23,an we do DJ dancing. Don't forget our DJ dancing. Sorry because the racing is starting these days?
17,Speaker 3,F,00:09:31,"I think it's going out into the Fresh air. I say that. But if I just let you use it fresh off, they need you to just go out. Yeah, I think it's expensive that I think as a matter of law, you can you could use it as well. Yes, I can live outside well, it's 50 times what. But once you get to the stage when some things that might help stem"
18,Speaker 4,F,00:10:15,"You know the Taichi, with a lot of older people, they don't realise it, but it is so good for you. Oh yeah. Do you konw if you get something really wrong with you and you have a physio? Let's say a physio, most of the exercises they do is the same ones that we do at Taichi, and it's just ample. Do you agree that it's good for you?"
19,Speaker 4,F,00:10:39,"Because it's a social event as well, it's not just going for the exercise.It's a social adventure, it sounds lovely."
20,Speaker 1,F,00:10:53,"Sorry, we shouted out the poor boy."
21,Speaker 4,F,00:10:55,It's a man man. Laughs. We do all lessons.
22,Speaker 3,F,00:10:58,"I tell you what, we'll take you with the nap state."
23,Speaker 6,F,00:11:01,You can come on first.
24,Speaker 5,F,00:11:02,I think I did Taichi and like this. It's like some all gentle exercise. It's chinese.I did it in China and ...
25,Speaker 4,F,00:11:15,"give me a bouncing ball, fans, and sticks  and they are very ..."
26,Speaker 4,F,00:11:31,"All right. So is there another reason for going out is the communication, even if you have only have a few words with a stranger and say, Good morning, how are you? Because it's so like, OK, it's so easy when you're on your own to lose the power of speaking. If you like of having a conversation, if you're on your own all the time, you're just sharing a television set and you're not getting anything constructive back from it."
27,Speaker 4,F,00:12:01,So it is quite easy then over time to lose the art of conversation.
28,Speaker 6,F,00:12:07,I sit on your board as well if you want to put swimming.
29,Speaker 6,F,00:12:14,"Yeah, in the life centre swimming."
30,Speaker 5,F,00:12:20,"And that's that's good, because it's easier than most exercises, isn't it? swimming in the water"
31,Speaker 1,F,00:12:43,just walk around again. Hmm. I don't want to Taichi. I do volunteering and I I'm back at Food Bank.
32,Speaker 3,F,00:13:04,"Coating on footwear, self-care. Yes. Some people come when they go into the shoes to do the shoes ..."
33,Speaker 1,F,00:13:49,"Yeah, I think it's important to keep in mind up to this. Well, very important."
34,Speaker 1,F,00:14:00,"Puzzles, crosswords, reading. Mm hmm. Yeah. Well, all the media stuff."
35,Speaker 4,F,00:14:07,"You've also got to be able to adapt to a change in your lifestyle. Things that you could quite easily do with, you know, you have domestic chores, putting the garbage outside, things like that. Sometimes you've got to adapt and find a different way of doing something that you're able to do so that you can still carry on doing it. It's not causing you any distress or worry. Simple things like my son in law, my son in law, my grandson has just moved everything off the top shelf to the middle shelf, in the kitchen cupboard because I've shrunk a bit and I can't reach the top ones anymore. So he's put the ones I don't use very much up there and put all the"
36,Speaker 4,F,00:14:55,"Yeah. So that. Every time they come out, I'm not saying, can you get me this, can you get me that? Yeah, he's already then for me. So, you know, you've got to look to adapt rather than say, I can't do something. You've got to try and find a different way of doing it."
37,Speaker 6,F,00:15:27,You've got to be careful with walking as well because of the stairs and ...
38,Speaker 6,F,00:15:49,"It causes it for pure nativism because I always hated House, but I forgot how hard it was hard to get enthusiastic about all these days. Laughs."
39,Speaker 4,F,00:16:02,It can be soul destroying because you aren't going to do it again.
40,Speaker 1,F,00:16:05,What's that?
41,Speaker 4,F,00:16:06,House works.
42,Speaker 3,F,00:16:07,"Oh, I hate it. Well, nobody likes it.I don't know some people do."
43,Speaker 1,F,00:16:16,We get going.
44,Speaker 4,F,00:16:18,"I tell you what is missing, is family. Yeah. If you're seeing your grand children and things like that, that visual let you have done it."
45,Speaker 3,F,00:16:27,"Some people are unable to do that, all their children and grand children and family live away. So you know, you just have to get on with it and go on with it basically."
46,Speaker 4,F,00:16:40,"You say last week, my grand son rang me and said, Can you come for breakfast today? And then? Yeah, I'm quite lucky because mine are in Plymouth."
47,Speaker 4,F,00:16:52,"No. Yeah, no. Well, I could travel to Malta to see my son.. and I'm not comfortable with that."
48,Speaker 4,F,00:17:02,"Yeah, yeah. I've got some family in Plymouth and some family away. So I used to because the children at school and stuff and got activities, I usually travel up there."
49,Speaker 6,F,00:17:20,"it becomes a challenge when you get older, because well, for the last 10, 11 years, I've been travelling to Canada every year for so long, I've got family there. But then the more I think about it now, especially after Covid, it's out frames frame that he performed in schools, tested in students. I mean, I just think of them as 10 and a half hours long. Yes. Yeah. And I think as you get older, it's a bit more daunting that I never used to think about. Mm-Hmm. But I've got older. Yeah. Yeah, you've got something."
50,Speaker 4,F,00:18:02,You can see more obstacles in your way. Don't you?
51,Speaker 5,F,00:18:07,It always seems so much more effort. Do I really want to go?
52,Speaker 6,F,00:18:12,"I think it's because you can overthink things, can't you?"
53,Speaker 3,F,00:18:14,"Yeah, I think it's it's because of Covid, that's why? Well, mine is going for a long time, isn't it? so..."
54,Speaker 7,M,00:18:25,"Get to the airport, put my case in, next stop. You know, the bark."
55,Speaker 5,F,00:18:46,"I volunteer for the home for the blind. And going back to keeping mind active, they do a crossword every morning and they know what they want to do it because they know that it's going to keep their mind active. And I think that's very important for them."
56,Speaker 7,M,00:19:16,"Gardening, yes."
57,Speaker 4,F,00:19:17,"I have plenty to plant but I'm not a gardener. I was never a gardener before. I will do a bit more now. Now, though,."
58,Speaker 7,M,00:19:31,"She was fine. she was all right. I mean, the first plant landed upside down"
59,Speaker 4,F,00:19:47,"No. Yeah, I don't like it."
60,Speaker 1,F,00:20:41,"Three. Yeah. Okay. So so one could be for the mind. Yeah. The other is physical like exercises, swimming and ..etc."
61,Speaker 2,F,00:20:54,"Because that comes back with exercises in that section because that can cope with the dancing and Taichi, and all this, that is exercise, isn't it?"
62,Speaker 4,F,00:21:06,Another important one is family of friends. Yeah.
63,Speaker 1,F,00:21:09,"Socialising. Socialising, activity and your mind."
64,Speaker 2,F,00:21:16,"I'm still looking out for people that need help. Yeah, it's a bit of a helping in hand."
65,Speaker 3,F,00:21:21,"But they're the three things that are important, our minds, our physical, and  socialising"
66,Speaker 4,F,00:21:48,"Social interaction is important, I think."
67,Speaker 1,F,00:21:59,"Well, there is my grandson. Yeah, as a friend, just as a friend, there's all sorts for him. But the problem is  the man is working at is getting elderly and he couldn't hardly walk but he stopped trying to walk."
68,Speaker 1,F,00:22:20,"Which is sad. because, you know, I know, and my ..."
69,Speaker 7,M,00:22:38,"Well, sometimes you get, you know, a bit negative. Yeah, I like to say something serene. You know? Yeah, like I said, that is it. Right? Well, yeah. You know that all these, you know?"
70,Speaker 3,F,00:22:53,"This really really helping it, yeah, without them, I don't know what we ca do."
71,Speaker 1,F,00:22:57,Wow. Know you just need someone to encourage him...
72,Speaker 7,M,00:23:00,"Yeah, just get him off the chair and just sit outside in the fresh air saying, try it now, but I've tried to say, man instead of me doing it today, you do it. You know? But he's afraid of falling over. The guy fell over several times and of course.."
73,Speaker 6,F,00:23:21,"It takes away any aches and pains you've got, right. But in a sympathetic ear or an arm to ..."
74,Speaker 7,M,00:23:29,Got in touch with the right people? Yes. To one another. Yeah.
75,Speaker 1,F,00:23:33,No. He doesn't want. We won't go along with with them. He won't go to the trouble of it. He can't be bothered.
76,Speaker 3,F,00:23:46,"I think it comes at a time in everyone's life when. They give up. Yeah, yeah. But you can't try to encourage them. Yeah. And I think, yeah, they don't really want to do it."
77,Speaker 7,M,00:24:00,"He's been so independent because, I mean, he was he was in the Marines, but he's been so independent and helping other people before he needed himself and he doesn't like it."
78,Speaker 4,F,00:24:11,"It's hard to accept. Yes, he doesn't want to be a bother. He doesn't want to be? All these people are worse off than me?"
79,Speaker 5,F,00:40:46,With technology in Italy being scammed. That's what worries me one thing is scamming.
80,Speaker 3,F,00:40:52,"Yeah. The problem with technology, you've got to teach the elderly people  how to use it. Yeah, I have many friends who would be , umm, would help them to to join a Zoom meeting or face talk, but they don't know how to use the technology. And that is the problem with them."
81,Speaker 3,F,00:41:35,"They don't know, yes. I've just been teaching someone. I downloaded Zoom for her and then I showed her how it works. But before that, she didn't have a clue about how it worked."
82,Speaker 5,F,00:41:52,"OK, It's trying to get somebody to explain how it works. Yeah, in simple terms, don't use any jargon, you know, and have patience. Yes, do it slowly, and you might have to go over a couple of times. But there was a company, a phone company EE, that used to run workshops and teach people how to use it. But I don't know if any places now."
83,Speaker 1,F,00:42:29,"So technology is good. Yeah. But then you've got to know how to use it, and also be careful, being safe as well when you're using these things. That's my priority all the time."
84,Speaker 6,F,00:42:55,"There is increasing pressure, they're trying to get you to spend money over the computer or bank over the computer, and I eventually refuse."
85,Speaker 6,F,00:43:06,"I will not do them over the computer, and I refuse to do that. I'll end up having doodies under the bed if need be, but ..."
86,Speaker 5,F,00:43:17,"I tell you what makes me very sad about technology is when you hear these people, these women that get sucked in by these men for all this money. Laughs. It's true, isn't it?  that's true. Yeah."
87,Speaker 7,M,00:43:30,It works both for and.
88,Speaker 5,F,00:43:32,"No, I know but they must be some loosing in their mind. I mean, how could anybody let's say my age, think about a 28 year old man's going to fancy me when he couldn't get anybody."
89,Speaker 7,M,00:43:46,We never know. Laughs.
90,Speaker 5,F,00:43:53,How old you are? Like 20.
91,Speaker 4,F,00:43:58,"Oh, yeah, but he doesn't put his own picture on...Laughs."
92,Speaker 5,F,00:44:03,"You were laughing, you've probably done it. Well, you put your own photo up. laughs."
93,Speaker 3,F,00:44:28,"So they won't use the phone to phone up, say different companies, because they know you phone their number and then you've got five different menus. Press this one, press that one. And even then, you don't get through. Even if you press the right number, you don't get through a person. You're given another menu. Well, by that time, it's got so frustrating that you hang up."
94,Speaker 3,F,00:44:54,"I know I get frustrated when it comes the message. Thank you for your patience. I don't have any. Laughs.You are important to me, answer the phone then."
95,Speaker 7,M,00:45:03,"And this is often very, very commonly when we call our GP. It's so difficult to talk to your GP, I mean, you just end up in these terrible menus."
96,Speaker 3,F,00:45:14,"I think that's why a lot of people don't get in contact with their doctors because you're hanging on and hanging on 30-35 minutes is common. And then you've got the receptionist who say your GP  will phone back. but then you can't be sat by the phone for a whole day waiting for the call. You go and do one little job, and that's when they call. So, You back to square one. Yeah. You know, and I think a lot of older people maybe have issues that really need seen to. Yeah, you know, and that just don't get helped there because of it. They give up in the end."
97,Speaker 1,F,00:45:58,"Well, it's hard as well as the same people who get older. Mm-Hmm. Everything's changing money wise. And COVID hasn't helped because obviously people weren't using cash or weren't accepting cash, so it was all going to be on your card, or whatever. Or you have to go in a bank to organise things, and a lot of people, older people don't work by card but they might find it hard to go on the cash machine and remember what to do to get what they want."
98,Speaker 5,F,00:46:37,"And if you're giving your card, if you've got carers coming in to do your shopping for you, then you would have to give them your card and your pin number, which is what you tell them not to do, you know?"
99,Speaker 5,F,00:46:52,"Years ago, when you got your pension, you had a book with the, you know, it said what money was due on what date. And that was quite safe because you could give that to a carer and they could only draw that much money out. But now, if you give them your card and your pin number, you don't know whether they need to accept it. They've could taken two lots of £50."
100,Speaker 5,F,00:47:16,So you would end up maybe not asking them to get you some food shopping.
101,Speaker 4,F,00:47:21,"Well, I think that's particularly relevant if you agree to have your bank statements online. Yeah, I was having out the sense so I can peruse it very carefully."
102,Speaker 4,F,00:47:32,"But I like to say it was right. It's like a friend of mine, Joe Drew. I mean, she was the same because she was doing that. But you know, it's not the one that lived in that specific. And then, of course, then when I was away on holiday, she took over the, you know, the cleaning girl. And of course, that was there. The money was just coming out."
103,Speaker 4,F,00:47:53,So they don't realise how much money is being spent because they have now.
104,Speaker 4,F,00:47:58,They've said that we
105,Speaker 4,F,00:47:59,given a five panel and got the change back from it.
106,Speaker 4,F,00:48:01,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, you know. Yeah."
107,Speaker 4,F,00:48:11,"about about living at home? Yeah, I live on the fourth floor, that's upstairs. There are still I'm done it. So one day in the future, I may find it difficult. Yeah, I'm fine at the moment. Mm-Hmm. I huffed and puffed day on the way up, but you know, I know it could be difficult. Eventually,."
108,Speaker 5,F,00:48:38,"When you move into a property, when you're younger, you don't always look ahead. And in 20 years, I'm I going to be going to these stairs, you know, am I going to be able to walk up that hill, which is not what you want to think about? No, you don't. Yeah."
109,Speaker 4,F,00:48:52,"So you've got the bath as well. I mean, I've got another bath and a lot of people have to share it, but in the future, you know, I keep thinking about will not be able to get in and out of the bath, you know? Yeah. Yeah, there are all sorts of little things that, you know, like in that picture of the door with the steps going up to it, your steps could be a big problem. They need handrails. There's no apparatus. Yeah, no handrails there. It's no good not that shining floor with the rugs on it. Yeah. And you can't get trapped."
110,Speaker 5,F,00:49:29,"You can't get a lot of help with getting adaptations done to your property to help you stay safer. But because older people living longer now, there is a long waiting list for it. So it could be that by the time you've come to the top of the list is that certain adaptation is no longer suitable for you."
111,Speaker 1,F,00:49:55,"I did notice as my husband got older, I had to remove all the little the matter in front of the fire. The base trip hazards because."
112,Speaker 1,F,00:50:18,"Helpful, what's helpful being in a bungalow or a flat because you don't have the stairs to go upstairs like."
113,Speaker 4,F,00:50:39,"I just want the lift for now that you take, you know? Yeah, I've already asked for it."
114,Speaker 5,F,00:50:45,"I've got it in advance, I've got written down. There is always the possibility to put one in, you know? Well, did you say"
115,Speaker 5,F,00:52:40,"Yeah. See, when I go to dancing, like this morning, I need to wake up at nine o'clock to get to Plympton and I live in the Barbican, but it's just you just don't do that if you want to do things. Yeah, sometimes you've got to just go where it is and where it's, you know, where it's available."
116,Speaker 5,F,00:52:59,"No, no. Half of the class do it on Hoe. Yeah. And some of them is up on the hoe and do it up there, which is nice."
117,Speaker 3,F,00:53:23,"To look out and see the sea, it's wonderful."
118,Speaker 1,F,00:53:25,"Nice parks, places to walk along the sea. It's it's really nice, really. I really appreciate this, it's beautiful. And it is accessible as well."
119,Speaker 6,F,00:53:39,"Yeah, I don't thnk that nowadays it's more important that you you go with someone rather than go walk on your own. Yes, I think sometimes it's a bit dangerous walking on your own, but I think you would love to walk. You walk out on your own."
120,Speaker 4,F,00:54:00,"I never think about it. I just go, I just do it because it's not at night."
121,Speaker 3,F,00:54:06,"But little, Jamie said to me, You know, little jean. Yeah, because sometimes she and I go walk together and she said, it's nice to with somebody because you see different things from when you're with somebody else and it's true. Yeah."
122,Speaker 5,F,00:54:36,Flat in Plymouth? Laughs... Plymouth must one of the hilliest place.
123,Speaker 1,F,00:54:37,The reason why we live so long is we walk up and down hills so much.
124,Speaker 3,F,00:55:00,"Well, it well pavements  much in full. Well, it had its share of terrible losses. You can easily fall down."
125,Speaker 7,M,00:55:11,"The only danger I can see is crime. Crime is a lot, isn't it?"
126,Speaker 3,F,00:55:24,I'm to kerb cruel and I didn't know whether to be in Sochi because he was a lady of the night on the ground that you still saw. Laughs...
127,Speaker 5,F,00:55:33,But you still got it. Don't put that down. Laughs...
128,Speaker 1,F,00:55:42,"I think most of us go to things that are put on for the older person that isn't working anymore. That can go to these things like dancing, swimming, exercising. And then you go off to the lectures and have news for you. Yeah, I think there are. There's more of that if you want to. If you can find in our walks created for health reasons, people with health reasons that want to walk and they walk us through the parks and everything, and it's sociable. Yes. So there's a lot to be thankful for that we felt like we found herself and she was lost, laughs... And she makes us do all sorts of things."
129,Speaker 5,F,00:56:42,"She kept us going through this lockdown, but soon enough she came on to..."
130,Speaker 5,F,00:56:59,"But you still can't have the motivation to go out enjoying them. And there are a lot of old people that have. I've not just got the motivation to go out there and you can tell them about what is going on in the, you know, in the city and what they can join in with. But a lot of it is, I think that when I've been in this long, it won't hurt me, you know, and they just don't feel that they've got confidence to go and catch a bus anywhere and walk into a new road and sometimes there used to be a buddy system. So I think, you know, you do need maybe a buddy to actually get you over that from doorstep and to join in. Mm-Hmm. I mean, as you can see, I think most the group of outgoing he would make of. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whereas if you've been in special through lockdown and how you used to being in doing your own thing, not not communicating much with other people that you just don't, you feel it's too much effort now, so they need to speak like a buddy system somewhere? Mm hmm."
131,Speaker 2,F,00:58:07,"And Hazel sometimes, bless her, you're in a meeting or somewhere with her and she'll come up and she'll whisper in your ear: ""can we go and have another word with him?"" and invite him to come and join whatever we're doing and we grab another one, don't we?"
132,Speaker 3,F,00:58:26,"Colin, sometimes I'll get into making the first move."
133,Speaker 2,F,00:58:28,George as well was going on as Hmm. Took him around the park this morning. Yeah.
134,Speaker 5,F,00:58:36,"Even twice. Yes, I did."
135,Speaker 3,F,00:58:39,"He took me in there and I took the test. He, suddenly I looked out of the corner of my eye and he was wobbling on his legs. He is over ninety bless him on Tuesday. And I thought, Oh God. And then I looked and I go switching for his puffer. I brought my first state book with me. But when it came round to it, they both said, No, we go round that extra bit as well, and they did. The whole lot would be. So they showed me through my test."
136,Speaker 3,F,00:59:12,"Yeah, they do kind of push themselves that little bit more, don't they? rather than give up."
137,Speaker 1,F,00:59:21,Coffee morning.
138,Speaker 5,F,00:59:24,"Bbut when they say coffee morning, it is in the pub."
139,Speaker 2,F,00:59:40,We spend a lot of time on Messenger. We have this spending time and I was on it until now.
140,Speaker 6,F,00:59:47,"Well, messages to us for most, not just people, is linked to this Facebook and its Facebook Messenger, isn't it? And messages as well. Yeah, messages. This is WhatsApp. Well, some are using WhatsApp."
141,Speaker 2,F,01:00:04,I use WhatsApp but I don't use Facebook or anything.
142,Speaker 5,F,01:00:06,You're not missing much when you don't use Facebook.
143,Speaker 1,F,01:00:09,"I know who you are, but I'm aware of some of the things I am, but I'm not. Fossil, but with forests in the oceans and the fishing and the palm oil thing, sharing all that, trying to get people to understand what we're all doing. But people get fed up, don't they? to seeing it. It's a fact of life that climate change is the big thing. It always seems to do with it."
144,Speaker 6,F,01:00:37,"I've only got one argument that a lot goes through it. I think, yes, I'll sign it. And then it says at the bottom. Donate. I can't  just donate  and I don't donate online anyway. ."
145,Speaker 1,F,01:02:22,Just stay in your accommodation.
146,Speaker 3,F,01:02:29,"as you know about public transport, access, accessible public transport."
147,Speaker 5,F,01:02:44,"It is not only public transport, but there's also something called Access Plymouth, so people can register and then book a trip if you've got to. If you want to go out to say to Taichi and you can't use public transport, you can book Access Plymouth and they will come and pick you up and drop to it and pick who can take you home again. You have to register and register for it. And there is a small fee. Yet you register in advance and then you book it. You've got to give you a couple of days notice. And there is a small fee you get built at the end of the month for it, but there's various things that you can book it for if you want to go shopping and things and. And I think it's run by volunteers, the drivers are. OK, but the ones I've seen I've never used it, once I've seen it always been really helpful."
148,Speaker 5,F,01:04:18,"No, I don't think so. Yeah, but you also can use something also use cars as well as mini cars for the minibuses. You know, so if you are a wheelchair user, for example, you could use that. Well, sometimes I'm afraid they will use the car for you."
149,Speaker 5,F,01:04:42,"So I think lots of these people live centrally. Don't you? Yeah, we do. You live in Derriford, but I live in Plymstock as well, but everybody else lives centrally rent. And so they won't be looking at the  transport, you know, the public transport."
150,Speaker 7,M,01:04:58,They don't have taxis today from community aims to begin
151,Speaker 5,F,01:05:01,and you got you got lost. Laughs..
152,Speaker 7,M,01:05:03,"No, that wasn't the taxi, that that was a human error."
153,Speaker 3,F,01:05:25,We've already said a couple of things. So you want us to pick three things out of them?
154,Speaker 3,F,01:05:56,You want three positives and three negatives.
155,Speaker 1,F,01:06:04,Transportation is positive. Yeah. So is Messenger really isn't. Yeah.
156,Speaker 5,F,01:06:10,Yeah. Access to nature
157,Speaker 2,F,01:06:12,access to nature is a blessing.
158,Speaker 4,F,01:06:14,Yeah. But you don't want to count. Three Don't. So what else would you say was the involvement then by the.
159,Speaker 3,F,01:06:25,"Well, the environment where you live and access to nature."
160,Speaker 1,F,01:06:28,"Yeah, yeah, not necessarily one side, but you could be inside no one like outside. Yeah, inside and outside the environment. Yeah. Well, I suppose that access to nature."
161,Speaker 1,F,01:07:21,I'm looking for stairs. Stairs is like a very big negative.
162,Speaker 2,F,01:07:28,I think how to use technologies.
163,Speaker 1,F,01:07:30,"Yes. OK. Yeah. Well, I think it's positive."
164,Speaker 2,F,01:07:35,"No, no, it's hard. Well, it's a step in the right way."
165,Speaker 4,F,01:08:05,"I mean, you can have your flat, your lift I mean."
166,Speaker 2,F,01:08:17,"No, I have to move, I see you do that. Well, that's going to be difficult. You don't want to move, do you?"
167,Speaker 1,F,01:08:51,"Stairs and Technology. What else? The trip overs? Well, that's that's all around us in the pavement. Yeah, yeah, but it's a negative thing isn't it? trip over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How many people fall over in the streets do? Yeah, yeah."
168,Speaker 5,F,01:09:44,"One of the things is like the internal environment that you live in. Yeah, because what was suitable for you when you moved in is not suitable now, and quite often the properties can't be adapted in any way or suitably for you. So it is moving out of the property living into something else. And you know, as you get older, you don't want to go through all the stuff in the loft. Get somebody elsedo that.Laughs.."
169,Speaker 8,M,01:10:49,That's a difficult one.
170,Speaker 1,F,01:10:55,Safe environment and messenger.
171,Speaker 1,F,01:11:07,"It's inclusive. Is it WhatsApp before it closes the Sharks? Snapchat, Snapchat"
172,Speaker 2,F,01:11:18,"Oh, I think that's sensitive. OK, and I can't look."
173,Speaker 8,M,01:11:24,"Technology, stairs and trip hazards"
174,Speaker 3,F,01:11:56,observations like that about what should I associated with at frustrated
175,Speaker 4,F,01:12:40,"Well, upstairs is not accessible rooms."
176,Speaker 3,F,01:12:49,"Yeah, exactly. No, no, no. I agree with you. There's focus one, A and B. I mean, Penny was talking about she's she's all right now. She might have to move.But OK, she can move. But then whatever she moves through, she's got to start finding new friends and things."
177,Speaker 6,F,01:13:16,"Of course, I haven't got any."
178,Speaker 4,F,01:14:02,Air quality. Oh yeah. Like bad air quality.
179,Speaker 4,F,01:14:23,Not being able to drive the car at the time.
180,Speaker 3,F,01:16:18,"But I think that is negative, isn't it?"
181,Speaker 1,F,01:16:21,The attitude that you come across?
182,Speaker 1,F,01:16:23,"It appears. Well, I don't think so. I think, you know that someone I think we were talking about all night."
183,Speaker 5,F,01:16:55,"Um, well, you know, when we do Taichi, that is attached to something called the Elder tree. OK, that's for like people that they come and see you in your home and things like that befriended, befriended and with the commune in that attitude they go to is Gordon and they've been doing his shopping."
184,Speaker 5,F,01:17:14,"Oh, good. Yeah, yeah. The Elder tree and they've been doing Gordon's shopping for it and they do all sorts of things,."
185,Speaker 5,F,01:17:36,"There is also silver line, which is another service for older people. So, you know, everybody thinks it's a taxi group in Plympton, but it's actually"
186,Speaker 2,F,01:18:49,"well, it's it's a common thing that you see now is ageist. Yeah. And it's the attitude towards older people. You know, where some people can't be bothered explaining things to them or helping them? You know, I'm sure that's different in banks, you know where they help them. But there are some people that just can't be bothered with them because they're older and more wobbly. And, you know, you would think. Well, I think it's just physical as well."
187,Speaker 3,F,01:19:29,"Sometimes they don't even notice you're there. They walk through, you're feeling invisible. Yes. Yeah, that's a good one definitely.It just seems strange now when shop assistants called me darling, and are you all right my love, sweetie..laughs. It seems a bit strange. I don't feel that."
188,Speaker 1,F,01:20:01,"Mm hmm. Yeah, that's negative, isn't it?"
189,Speaker 3,F,01:20:04,"Well, it's kind, isn't it kindly? I don't take offence by it. I just seems..."
190,Speaker 2,F,01:20:08,"but people could be offended, couldn't they?"
191,Speaker 3,F,01:20:11,"Yeah, yeah. But if they sort of humped and glumped because I was a bit slow putting stuff into my bag, I'd get upset then so I can take that one."
192,Speaker 5,F,01:20:22,"Well, I suppose it's a perception of what is an older person. Yeah, if you're 18, anybody over 30."
193,Speaker 1,F,01:20:28,"So yeah, yeah. You know? When you get to 70, well, there's no chance you just think, you know, you know, that's it."
194,Speaker 3,F,01:20:42,"I'm quite content in my life here, you know?"
195,Speaker 3,F,01:20:46,We've got about 30 years.
196,Speaker 3,F,01:20:51,They want life to be nice.
197,Speaker 5,F,01:20:53,"I don't go back 30 years because I was in a divorce then, I'll go back 25 years."
198,Speaker 2,F,01:21:14,"That might put, you know, I might be put off, although I might put them off if I tried to go raving Glastonbury. Oh no, I go to Glastonbury, but no, not at raving, no, no, no."
199,Speaker 4,F,01:22:54,"Not really, no."
200,Speaker 1,F,01:23:07,"Not in my case, but I suppose in the future mine would be. Carrying shopping up the of all the stairs that's the problem, and if you get it delivered, they don't bring it up the stairs."
201,Speaker 4,F,01:24:01,But the taxi driver always brings up. I don't think he likes it. He doesn't get much choice. He just get some shopping
202,Speaker 6,F,01:24:18,"And it won't be Morrisons because they put everything in a big plastic basket, not in bags. So they're not going to bring those shopping up the stairs,."
203,Speaker 7,M,01:24:32,You've got some undesirable people in our block.
204,Speaker 5,F,01:24:34,That's a negative one as well.  the deliveries? Yes. Yeah.
205,Speaker 6,F,01:24:57,We should be careful. Yes.
206,Speaker 1,F,01:25:03,And that makes their minds.
207,Speaker 1,F,01:25:24,"Maybe by that time, Hazel bought you a lift."
208,Speaker 2,F,01:25:39,"Well, my family helps me. Yeah, so we put family down. That's a positive."
209,Speaker 4,F,01:25:45,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. absolutely, because my daughter ..."
210,Speaker 5,F,01:26:36,"Negative! It depends which side you're looking at, that side is nice, and that side is not."
211,Speaker 4,F,01:26:40,"Yeah, we've got like good and bad."
212,Speaker 5,F,01:26:59,"I think it depends on what kind of property you live in. If you live in a block of flats and you know, several neighbours in that block, officials say there's seven other flats there. Out of those seven, you're going to find a couple that would be helpful. Yeah. You know, but I live on a busy main road and I believe that 32 years and I only know the neighbours of either side because everybody was out and about to work and everything. So I don't really know them."
213,Speaker 4,F,01:27:29,"Oh, I was saying about when the weather was really bad. The young man that lives just across the road upstairs from he came down and so did make above me. And then you're not going out with anything you want, will get it for you. Which is lovely and sweet."
214,Speaker 1,F,01:27:47,Very nice. isn't it?
215,Speaker 2,F,01:29:05,"I think where we live that we fall out occasionally, it's more like a big family. Mm hmm. Yeah. You know, even if you fall out with somebody, if they need help, everybody rush out and."
216,Speaker 2,F,01:29:21,"Yes, that particular Barbican community."
217,Speaker 6,F,01:29:26,"It's differen from whereI live because all the people in the property I live in are all the same age, you know, so you don't have that makes, and in a way that is a negative thing for me personally. But you know. We're all kind of clumped together because we're getting old."
218,Speaker 1,F,01:29:53,"Well, we're the same."
219,Speaker 6,F,01:29:55,"Yes, but you do have younger people working."
220,Speaker 1,F,01:29:59,Playing loud music and have party.
221,Speaker 3,F,01:30:02,Join them. laughs...Yeah.
222,Speaker 1,F,01:30:04,Not at one o'clock in the morning. So it could be it could be a negative thing.
223,Speaker 5,F,01:30:21,"This morning, I got a Facebook friend request from Young Georgie, so I remember being born to make life above me, and now she's got kids of her own. She wanted me as a Facebook friend. Laughs. That's not bad. I've known since the day she was born."
224,Speaker 8,M,01:32:16,"The deliveries, delivery services, as a negative, because they don't bring it all the way up the stairs."
225,Speaker 3,F,01:32:26,"Technology is, the fact of the social and gotten social justice. Oh, social and social."
226,Speaker 2,F,01:32:45,"Easy access to things, I suppose. When you are older, you know, stais, for example."
227,Speaker 1,F,01:33:13,You can write down what you like when we're gone. Laughs.
228,Speaker 1,F,01:33:59,So it was this this is all towards. I understood that it was how a robot could help you in.
229,Speaker 2,F,01:34:49,We look forward to that.
