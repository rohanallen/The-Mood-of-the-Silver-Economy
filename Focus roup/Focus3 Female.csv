0,0,Speaker 1,F,00:01:25,You're welcome participation as well. No worries.
1,1,Speaker 2,F,00:03:52,I live on my own.
2,2,Speaker 3,F,00:03:53,I live on my own too
3,3,Speaker 4,F,00:03:55,I live with my partner and my two cats.
4,5,Speaker 1,F,00:04:02,"I live with my partner, and sadly no, no cat ."
5,6,Speaker 3,F,00:04:52,"Very important. Well, obviously I'm not at home all the time. All. It's my space. It's my home, and I can do anything I want. I don't have to please anyone."
6,8,Speaker 3,F,00:05:28,My children are always on the phone.
7,10,Speaker 1,F,00:05:30,"Yeah, that's my biggest fear. I don't have children. I don't want to be amongst other people. I want to stay inmy own home, but what happens if Rob is not there like it and I get poorly, I just die in the living room probably. Laughs.."
8,11,Speaker 3,F,00:05:44,"I mean, you know, we're lucky we got intercoms posts in our flat. So if benefit was to happen, we could get straight on a medical. So my hope is that gives me confidence. What my daughter come down for 10 days before it's gone?"
9,12,Speaker 3,F,00:06:02,"She took over my telly, she took over my chair and everything else I don't like. I'm like oh, oh."
10,13,Speaker 1,F,00:06:21,"And also when you've got a lot of people around you that you're not used to having around you, you're like, Oh, I have to dress, I have to brush my hair. I have to be on my best behaviour. I have to be nice to people."
11,14,Speaker 3,F,00:06:33,"You take me up so hard, if you don't like it, bye bye."
12,15,Speaker 2,F,00:06:38,"But let's do it, and I work you from home like we are now, aren't we? It's just very. The only time I actually put all my work clothes is ... Now, obviously we are allowed to go out and do visits again when we were when it was totally working from home. Any time I would actually get dressed, get sort of get dressed, put in a nice top and brush my hair was when we had Zoom meetings. Otherwise, I'll be like... yeah."
13,17,Speaker 2,F,00:07:02,"and I keep my pyjamas on, you know it's raining what I want to get dressed for."
14,18,Speaker 3,F,00:07:08,"Because at young age after you spend all your life trying to impress people, you become so many different people's to try to fit in, and you lose your own identity, you know, so I think, well, if you don't like me, so I'm not going to like me if I'm dressed in mine. So, yeah, you know, professional person, they're not going to like me."
15,19,Speaker 2,F,00:07:26,So this is no surprises.
16,20,Speaker 2,F,00:07:32,"When  you're saying about living independently. So I when my two were little, I worked in several different care homes like one was a Devon County care home and it's gone now. It's a 52 bed one. And it was their lounges on three separate floors. Much the same size as six chairs all the way around, and in the corner was like I say, a normal sized TV like we would've had years ago in our own front rooms, not as big as these  even, and people were just staring at that space or nothing in sight. And I would hate the thought that that would ever happen to me. You know, it's just it's horrendous."
17,21,Speaker 1,F,00:08:17,"I don't like the idea of not being able to eat the foods that I want to eat. So somebody is going to come and give me like school dinners, a plate of something that I don't like or don't enjoy. And that's my only choice, especially if I'm in a position where, you know, I'm not well enough to go out and buy food or cook food. So that scares me. The I'll spend the end of my life, you know, just looking at the slop on the plate"
18,23,Speaker 2,F,00:08:43,"You can't. Just existing, not doing anything."
19,24,Speaker 1,F,00:08:46,"No joy! Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it takes all the joy out of life is, you know, this is all that's left to me. I don't have to worry about my weight anymore, but look what I've got to eat and that's not very inspiring."
20,25,Speaker 2,F,00:08:57,"Exactly, I want to enjoy my food because ."
21,26,Speaker 1,F,00:09:01,"Yeah, what's left to me?"
22,27,Speaker 2,F,00:09:03,"Yeah, I am not able to walk or anything, but yeah, you just yeah..."
23,28,Speaker 4,F,00:09:08,"I've got got a man living next door to me, he is a hundred and one, and without a support from his family, I don't know, how he would get on because he's slowing down more and more and more is falling over a lot. He sits out to eat his food and everything else. So, you know, see, without  family around. You can be a bit lost."
24,29,Speaker 1,F,00:09:35,Thanks for that sort of thing.
25,30,Speaker 4,F,00:09:37,"I'm sorry, but my family's no good. I'm better off without them. You know, I came out of hospital after an operation and its first time I asked my daughter to come up to look after me and I am the one who has to get up and do the dinner. So what would change? hello."
26,32,Speaker 2,F,00:11:34,"So Mary Poppins, I will sing it in my head. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Uh, uh,"
27,33,Speaker 2,F,00:11:52,"uh, exercise. I like to walk in, but obviously I have problems with my legs now. So in ten years time, I don't know. Well, it's my sisters and my mom is the same, so"
28,34,Speaker 1,F,00:12:11,"I'd agree because, as you know, I don't. Yeah, so I want to be able to keep them dancing as long as possible. But also I don't want people to just say, Oh, Hazel, this is your chronological age. So you now have to do seated exercise when you get to do this kind of exercise because they they've seen me on a piece of paper saying that, you know, you may be this age. So they've made an assumption about what I can do physically or not."
29,35,Speaker 2,F,00:12:39,"So they have pigeonholed you. I'd say, Yeah,"
30,37,Speaker 2,F,00:12:51,"and cycling,"
31,38,Speaker 3,F,00:12:53,"I've never been on the bike for years,."
32,39,Speaker 4,F,00:12:54,"I  know, we should go bike riding."
33,41,Speaker 2,F,00:12:59,"Yeah, but you've got electric bikes today, you know, I think it makes it easier."
34,42,Speaker 3,F,00:13:08,"After another 10 years, I might have a scooter."
35,43,Speaker 1,F,00:13:11,"Yeah, you can. Do you miss walking?"
36,44,Speaker 3,F,00:13:15,I used to walk everywhere.
37,45,Speaker 1,F,00:13:16,Do you miss it now that you can't do it? Well.
38,46,Speaker 3,F,00:13:18,"No, I do miss it because I've got this bulges in my spine and the the vertebraes are starting to crumble. And I might get a pinch in my nerve, and my legs just give up and fall to the floor. So I was out with my daughter last week to the Barbican to the Hooe, every five minutes or so, I sit down. And the last two bus stops, I've got a bus I wanted to go home. and I suffered for days after. I don't take painkillers because of if I ever do it and I could, my legs could collapse way with me while I go across the road or anything like that."
39,47,Speaker 2,F,00:13:57,"Yeah, this is kind of masks the real problem, doesn't it?"
40,48,Speaker 3,F,00:14:01,"Yeah, sort of.."
41,49,Speaker 1,F,00:14:04,"I think washing, and that sounds a bit bizarre. But washing and looking after myself, dressing myself, you know, in the future, yeah, feels like a bit of a scary prospect. You know, you got yourself if you've had an operation, you got hit by a car, so you can actually look. And seeing how little it takes for you to not be able to wash or getting out of the bath and, you know, look, look after yourself. You don't think of it when you're well. But as soon as you can't do that.."
42,50,Speaker 4,F,00:14:36,"My mom, she's got diabetes and she goes for dialysis three times a week. She's she's blind, so she she can't cook for herself. My sister's a carer. But she can still shower herself a shower. She can still get herself ready, but she gets so upset because she can't see, so, yeah, yeah, and yeah, so it's really hard for like, see my mom being like family, she was doing everything for me. Now, it's the other way around, but my daughter sees that, you know, like with my grand children, she says, you're wiping their bums. I'll be wiping your bum when we get old. I don't ever want you to do that. She says that to me all the time, I just doesn't say bums."
43,51,Speaker 2,F,00:15:45,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can imagine. What is she looking forward to it or something?"
44,52,Speaker 4,F,00:15:50,"I don't know, laughs. So I don't go to do this, do that, but do that. Can you change Alison's nappy, I don't know. For God's sake, Laura, I'm just want to sit down for two minutes and say this. Don't worry, I'll be doing yours when you get old. I'll be wiping."
45,53,Speaker 2,F,00:16:25,"Oh, bless you."
46,55,Speaker 4,F,00:16:36,"Yeah, my mom is all like that sometimes, she'd say  I wish I weren't here and she's eighty six this year."
47,56,Speaker 3,F,00:16:48,"When you get to that age, you have to rely on the people you trust, people that are going to look after you. You don't think they're going to abuse you, because in 10 years time I could have Alzheimer's, you know, so you're thinking differently. Yeah, try to trust I mean to trust,  trust people that are coming to look after you, are going to look after you well."
48,57,Speaker 1,F,00:17:06,"And I don't think there's a problem with ... Rayan was just saying you can't do things, but you don't realise you can't do things until you fall off the ladder trying to change the light bulb. Yeah, yeah. You have an accident because you haven't realised that maybe physically you can't do what you always been able to do."
49,58,Speaker 2,F,00:17:25,"So it's kind of a gradual thing, isn't it? Like with your eyesight and your hearing. I mean, my mom's 88 now, and she's always had really good hearing, but I know lately that she'll say, yeah, or she'll think she's answered what I've said, but I know she's not heard me. And yeah, and you think it's because it's not overnight thing unless you have a serious illness"
50,59,Speaker 4,F,00:17:47,"and it's like those things she's always repeating herself. I'll say, yes, mom, you told me the other day, and you know,"
51,60,Speaker 4,F,00:18:06,I look after my grandchildren all the time because my daughter works. So and now it's a six weeks holidays.
52,61,Speaker 2,F,00:18:17,"You're a busy, girl."
53,62,Speaker 4,F,00:18:26,"Yeah, but I've always been a giver. I'm not a taker, so. Me too. Anything you can do to help someone, I will."
54,63,Speaker 2,F,00:18:38,"it's like my next door neighbours through lockdown. The wife has got really serious cancer and treatments doctor in lockdown. And so I did their shopping. I mean, I only ordinarily do shopping once a month, but they like best weekly because it does. So I was coming into Plymouth every week to do the shopping because I had to be in Lidl's, so I held my breath go into Lidl's."
55,64,Speaker 2,F,00:19:05,"Phew! I'm home. So it was really stressful. I don't want to get this disease. Yeah. So that was, you know, it was just nice to be able to do things for them. But then he's a builder. And so he reciprocated by building us a porch, when I gone shopping and you said, Well, you're not going to be there, so I'll go and do your front porch. So I came back and it was almost finished that way. Wow!"
56,65,Speaker 4,F,00:19:33,"So, yeah, yeah, I think, yeah, that scares me having people look after me and not the other way around."
57,66,Speaker 2,F,00:19:45,"Yes, definitely."
58,67,Speaker 1,F,00:19:45,I don't want to be looked after.
59,68,Speaker 2,F,00:19:52,I'm too independent for that.
60,69,Speaker 1,F,00:19:52,And they wouldn't it do it right anyway.
61,70,Speaker 2,F,00:19:52,Of course not.
62,71,Speaker 1,F,00:19:58,Cooking for start. You see it is a theme here.
63,72,Speaker 4,F,00:20:02,"Cooking, cleaning. just do everything that you normally do. That person does, you know,"
64,73,Speaker 1,F,00:20:09,"and you have to be grateful as well. Yeah, which I don't want to be."
65,74,Speaker 1,F,00:20:13,I'm going to be really miserable. Oh yeah.
66,75,Speaker 2,F,00:20:15,But to be beholden to anybody.
67,76,Speaker 1,F,00:20:17,"Because you have to be grateful that somebody is coming and doing it and they have their way of doing it. But you have your way of doing things and it's like, I don't want it, I want it done how I want it, but I'm just going to have to accept. And again, that just adds, and I think I'll probably end up quite low and depressed thinking, Yeah, I didn't have the control of anything."
68,77,Speaker 2,F,00:20:37,"Yeah, you have to compromise all the time, isn't it? Yeah, yeah."
69,80,Speaker 1,F,00:20:50,you're quite easygoing.
70,82,Speaker 3,F,00:20:57,"Yeah, I still look after my children, even though my eldest is thirty nine next month and my youngest is 31, I still look after them, you know? Mm yeah, it'll be hard. Like I said, Lara said, she's going to be looking after me. That's my eldest. So be hard for me not being able to look after her because I still do."
71,83,Speaker 1,F,00:21:27,What if she moves away? What if she immigrated to Canada?
72,84,Speaker 3,F,00:21:30,She should take me with her
73,85,Speaker 1,F,00:21:32,"What if you were in a position where your children weren't the people caring for you, like strangers?"
74,86,Speaker 3,F,00:21:39,"Yeah, because I've got four children and my girls are here. My boys have moved away. So, yeah,"
75,87,Speaker 1,F,00:21:48,Because not everybody has their family.
76,88,Speaker 3,F,00:21:50,"Yeah, yeah, I know that."
77,89,Speaker 1,F,00:21:51,And not everybody has a family whose wants to or able to look after them. yeah. Hmm.
78,90,Speaker 2,F,00:21:57,"It's about trusting a stranger, isn't it?"
79,91,Speaker 4,F,00:22:00,"??? trust anyone because I've got a life of people all my life and just trust in it takes a long time. I can be with a group of people in the community room, but I don't have to be friends with them, I don't have to associate, I can come straight back into my room."
80,92,Speaker 2,F,00:22:18,"Yeah, that's your sanctuary, isn't it? It's your safe place. Yeah. And yeah, and it's invading your personal space."
81,93,Speaker 4,F,00:22:57,Shopping.
82,94,Speaker 2,F,00:22:58,"Oh, blimey, no!"
83,95,Speaker 4,F,00:23:04,I would go shopping for everyone.
84,96,Speaker 2,F,00:23:11,"See mine is still at the top, like gardening and doing exercise. Yeah, that's really, that's my life."
85,97,Speaker 1,F,00:23:17,"Yeah, mine is dancing because that's all I do outside of work. But equally, I would find it really difficult if I had any visual impairment as I got older because I think there's so much that I do that would be totally different."
86,98,Speaker 1,F,00:23:30,"and I don't know. Obviously, I would learn I would adapt, but I would find that really difficult journey to sight loss. Hearing loss, maybe I could deal with a little bit better, but I would find sight loss a really big issue to deal with."
87,99,Speaker 2,F,00:23:46,"Yeah, ditto because I'm aware, you know, I get dry eyes now all the time and that drives me mad. Yeah. It's not something that they can fix."
88,100,Speaker 4,F,00:24:00,"Yeah, my mom's got that muscular degeneration. So she's not completely blind. It's just a false. And she gets really upset because obviously the past six and a half years I became, I became a granny with my eldest do seven in October, and there is one on the way and every time I go home, I'll take pictures of them. And she gets really upset because she can't see them"
89,101,Speaker 1,F,00:24:30,"But it takes so much away, doesn't it? You can't read, you can't do puzzles, you can't watch films, you can't look at photographs with your loved ones."
90,102,Speaker 4,F,00:24:44,"Yeah, yeah. My mom used to read every night before she went to bed. She has those tapes now. Audio tapes? Yeah. She used to love bingo.  Yeah, she used to be at the bingo five times a week. And she can't. She can't now so ..."
91,104,Speaker 2,F,00:25:24,"Yeah, yeah. I think I like taking photos as well. And so that be hard, you know, you can have the autofocus, but it's nice sometimes to just do it again and due to what you will and I do take photos now without my glasses, but I know it's getting harder. Yeah. And I don't want to have contact lenses to make it easier because I just can't stand the thought of putting something in my eyes. And so even at that, that would be awful if I, you know, so I love walking on the moors to the live on the moors and taking photos to babysit. To have those two things taken away from me."
92,105,Speaker 1,F,00:26:05,"That's a combination of loss, I've lost one thing but it is accurate loss of  ... I like watching people what I like to sit in a coffee shop and watch people and what's going on around me. Because it's sometimes makes me feel less isolated just seeing life around me. But again, if I couldn't do that, yeah,"
93,106,Speaker 2,F,00:26:26,"I know my two. When they were little, we used to make up lives of people doing that. We'd sit and eat. Shall we make up thier lives? What do you think of that? She is a spy? Yeah, well, yeah, right.We give them a really, really interesting lives, they might have them but yeah, so?"
94,108,Speaker 2,F,00:26:48,"To yourself, I hope."
95,109,Speaker 4,F,00:27:11,I've got these calls all the time .
96,111,Speaker 2,F,00:27:31,"Oh, that was 2010. Go away."
97,113,Speaker 4,F,00:27:58,"yeah, that's one of my hobbies is walking, even though that I can't do. I used to go walking every day."
98,114,Speaker 1,F,00:28:06,"So out of that list walked on the kind of the general. We think of the top three, the."
99,115,Speaker 1,F,00:28:14,"Oh, Yeah. Exercise, yeah. Yeah. So exercise self-care."
100,116,Speaker 4,F,00:28:23,"Watching TV, I love  to sit down and watch TV. Yes, TV, I like all the soaps."
101,118,Speaker 1,F,00:28:47,Yeah. Depending on your cooking skills. Laughs...
102,119,Speaker 3,F,00:28:56,Probably taking care of myself
103,120,Speaker 2,F,00:28:58,"we've got self care. Yeah. Yes, socialising, because it would be awful to be in a totally isolated, wouldn't it?"
104,121,Speaker 4,F,00:29:24,"See, I like being on my own Sometimes."
105,123,Speaker 4,F,00:29:34,"Yeah. I go to my church every Sunday, and if it weren't for getting a lift there, I like socialising with them, it's a smaller group and it's more like a family. It's not a great big church and it's nice once a week or we go out for a meal, you know, so there is a certain amount of socialising."
106,124,Speaker 2,F,00:29:56,"Yeah. Just maybe just meeting other people in general in what however, you like to do it. If you know if it's going to the cinema with friends, go for a meal with people"
107,125,Speaker 4,F,00:30:09,in this is like socialisation?
108,126,Speaker 2,F,00:30:14,Even going to work is in a way.
109,127,Speaker 4,F,00:30:21,"I don't mind being on my own but if I was on my own all the time, I wouldn't like it, because obviously I'm busy with my grandchildren and sometimes I just like to be at home on my own doing nothing. But if I didn't have that, I probably wouldn't like it."
110,128,Speaker 1,F,00:30:44,"I mean, obviously during this time, I've talked to a lot of people who do live alone, and maybe the one Zoom call that I do with them a week is the only contact they have."
111,129,Speaker 3,F,00:30:55,"Oh, that's frightening."
112,130,Speaker 1,F,00:30:56,"Yeah. And I think, yeah, when I start thinking about it, it reminds me actually how terrifying that must be, you know, not having any contact andnot being able to speak to anyone. And I think we've all seen it, haven't we? The, you know, an older person at the checkout in a supermarket and just chatting to the cashier. And especially if you're in a rush to get back to work or something or go somewhere, you like the for goodness sake, you know, just move along. But in the back of your mind, you know, that may be the only current contact that person must have. So I think that we can be quite flippant about socialising because we get it. Yeah, yeah. But I can't begin to imagine how how debilitating it is if if literally you get up and there's no one and you go to bed and you've spoken to no one in, that happens day."
113,131,Speaker 1,F,00:31:48,"Also, you may not have the physical ability to get out and meet new people or the confidence to just turn up to something and can't join this club or something that must super frightening."
114,132,Speaker 3,F,00:31:59,"Where I live in community homes. We do take care of each other and the staff family. And if they're not, there is always somebody there if you need. You know, I'm helping people. Yeah, I'm helping people and people will help me. Yeah, it's needed. So you don't see each other for a couple of days before. Oh, and go and look at shopping. So I'm lucky that I'm there."
115,133,Speaker 1,F,00:32:25,"Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I've lived in my house since 1988, and I still don't know the neighbours."
116,134,Speaker 1,F,00:32:33,"Yeah, well, I know them, but we don't talk to each other. Yeah, yeah. I mean, nobody talks to each other at all."
117,135,Speaker 4,F,00:32:39,"Yeah, it's like I live on the Barbican and some of the some of the neighbours are lovely. Others don't even bother with you. You know, I'm always like this: "" Hello, good morning"" but I'm like that."
118,136,Speaker 2,F,00:32:54,"They are looking at you like you're strange. Yeah, yeah."
119,137,Speaker 2,F,00:32:56,"I mean, I think it's the world we're living in now."
120,138,Speaker 4,F,00:32:58,"Yeah, yeah. But like I say, I know a lot of people where I live so, you know, I'm never on my own. and there is always someone there."
121,139,Speaker 2,F,00:33:12,"But now what if I say do, too, and that is the only contact I know we get it a lot. And I know you like your teams, but you were phoning people on their own when, you know, through lockdown. Yeah, and you said the same team."
122,140,Speaker 1,F,00:33:25,Yes. Yes.
123,141,Speaker 1,F,00:33:28,"Um, and we would get leaseholders as well, like I did. We we don't find them like you would for tenants. But you know, when we're speaking with our like more elderly leaseholders, you can't get them off the phone. And it's just they just want to talk and talk. And oh, we really, really something. Don't be sorry. That's fine with us. Somebody else will pick up the phone to somebody else is. You know, it's just ..."
124,142,Speaker 1,F,00:33:51,"And I think sometimes it's not your problems. You don't necessarily want to talk to other people about your problems. But it's when something funny or something really positive has happened to you. You want to share with someone and then it's like, Oh, oh, I can't tell anyone and I've got nobody to tell my good news to, you know, that must be really difficult."
125,143,Speaker 1,F,00:34:12,"And again, I suppose, you know, it's all about being going, losing your eyesight, maybe losing your hearing. Then when you don't have that communication, you know, that must be quite isolating as well."
126,146,Speaker 1,F,00:34:36,"You know, it is still used as a punishment.So that just goes to show that, doesn't it? That's how you punish human beings and actually isolate them. Yeah, yeah."
127,149,Speaker 1,F,00:35:35,Yes. And that's an understatement.
128,150,Speaker 4,F,00:35:38,"I'm an ex smoker and I, you know. But I smoked until just after the pop started to stop you, and I used to be outside every five minutes up in smoke if I. So I do understand when you want a cigarette? Yeah."
129,151,Speaker 2,F,00:36:10,Did they say that all the most important meetings go on in the smoking area?
130,152,Speaker 2,F,00:36:25,All the big decisions are made.
131,154,Speaker 2,F,00:36:34,"Yeah, I guess you can just pretend, you know, one of those candy ones we used to have when we were little."
132,156,Speaker 4,F,00:50:15,Oh the worst one is opening a tin
133,157,Speaker 1,F,00:50:19,O Jar Jar. Oh yeah.
134,158,Speaker 3,F,00:50:24,"I think everyone knows what kind of problem. I know, I know. Sometimes, you can get it open easily and other times, it's just won't. Yeah. Yeah. Bang it!"
135,159,Speaker 2,F,00:50:35,"You can get a gadget, though."
136,161,Speaker 2,F,00:50:41,"My mom's got one to make it easier, but it's knowing that you can get that gadget , that's the thing."
137,162,Speaker 1,F,00:50:49,"So I have very high ceilings in my house they are nine foot tall, so to actually change a light bulb needs a ladder. I also have one light bulb that hangs over the stairwell, which you have to get on top of a ladder. Somebody has to hold your legs and you have to lean over, Oh God, the drop to change the bulb. Oh no. And every time I have to do it, I am so terrified. And that's now. So if that light goes in the future."
138,163,Speaker 2,F,00:51:21,It's going to say dark. Laughs
139,164,Speaker 1,F,00:51:23,but it's the hallway light that lights the whole stairs. So then I would have no light in the stairs.
140,166,Speaker 1,F,00:51:30,"Well, I I guess if I had the money to have somebody come and, you know, do the job. But yeah, that would need somebody quite... Because it will need scaffolding. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, because it's three floors high and the the one lights on three floors high and literally dangling over and you can see the floor and you're like ...."
141,167,Speaker 4,F,00:52:01,Get them on the wall.
142,168,Speaker 1,F,00:52:03,"Yeah, but I was saying it's going to be quite an expensive job."
143,169,Speaker 2,F,00:52:07,"I think any maintenance issue, isn't it? When you getting older that you can't do it yourself. You know, even like, you know, cleaning the windows outside, I can do it now, but you know, in the future,."
144,170,Speaker 1,F,00:52:20,"And it's that balance, isn't it? between because I think one of the things that worries me about getting older and having a pension is not having enough money because I don't have resources. So if you can't do things for yourself or you have to have adaptations, you have to be able to pay for them. So if I'm on a small pension and I can't afford to pay to have things done in the house repairs or adaptations."
145,172,Speaker 4,F,00:52:56,"But I think there are places you can go and they'll come out and do it for you. But you own your own home. So I don't have it works that way. Yeah, but I know people like my sister. She couldn't get in the bath, no more so they came out to put  the shower in, and she's got like a toilet. Yeah. So because she can't, she's on one of those walkers now."
146,174,Speaker 1,F,00:53:29,"Yeah, maybe."
147,175,Speaker 4,F,00:53:29,"That's what I meant, social services."
148,176,Speaker 3,F,00:53:32,All depends how much money you 've got.
149,177,Speaker 1,F,00:53:35,"And how serious your condition is becauseI might feel that my situation is serious, but somebody assessing me in a very formalised way."
150,178,Speaker 1,F,00:53:45,"Social services may say, Oh, we don't think that you're needy enough."
151,179,Speaker 3,F,00:53:50,"Yeah, yeah, I'm going to get a stool to sit on so that I can do peeling vegetables or cooking or anything like that. If I make the bed, I have to stop because of the pain in my back, so that  can take me hours, even put a hoover around. I have to stop, sit down place my back so that can take ages. So actually, I might need a cleaner."
152,180,Speaker 1,F,00:54:13,"Yeah, and that's going to cost you. You know, and you have the resources. Yeah. And then again, that's somebody coming in your home that you might not want."
153,181,Speaker 3,F,00:54:20,"Yeah, yeah."
154,183,Speaker 1,F,00:54:41,"Yeah, yeah. And there is the pride as well, isn't it?"
155,184,Speaker 4,F,00:54:46,"Because my mom was the same. She didn't know she she had a pension, and that was it until she stopped going blind and social service came out, filled all these forms for her. She's getting fortune now."
156,185,Speaker 1,F,00:55:02,"Yeah, but that is depending on somebody letting social services know."
157,186,Speaker 4,F,00:55:08,"And my mom doesn't think that she should be entitled to it now. Well, if you're not entitled to take it off you."
158,188,Speaker 4,F,00:55:25,"Yeah, yeah."
159,189,Speaker 1,F,00:55:26,"I think also my house is designed for me at my health and my height and my capabilities. If any of those change, you know, I won't be able to reach the cupboards. I won't be able to get down, you know, if I were in a wheelchair or was having to use sticks to get around things that are simple now. Yeah, you know, would suddenly just be impossible to manage."
160,190,Speaker 2,F,00:55:52,"So I mean, we've only got like a two story and not really high ceilings, but they're coming down the stairs. We've not got banisters because don't need banisters at the moment. And one of I actually. And we've got like one door the front door. To go out of that to get up to the main road to the path  we've about 12 steps. So again, like if I, you know, if my abilities gone. How would I get up those steps. Because you know my next door neighbour, he's got the cancer, her husband, she's got a mobility scooter now. And he took away the steps and put in a ramp. But it's like, Wow, it's a bit steep. I would say, mice, imagine, you know, going down it and disappearing down in the garden. wow..laughs"
161,191,Speaker 2,F,00:56:45,"So it's that, you know, all of that you think, Oh, so you like you can do all of these things now quite easily, but in years to come? Yeah, I saw those in it adapting your home to suit. Yeah."
162,192,Speaker 1,F,00:56:57,"And shopping. You know, obviously, we go shopping. We take the car. If I wanted to get the bus, I would then have to maybe shop small every day because I'd have to walk back from the bus stop, which is close to the house. I wouldn't be able to carry much. And if I got a trolley, I wouldn't be able to lift the trolley onto the bus to get, you know, so I'd constantly be having to think about what do we need? What can I carry? How far do I have to carry aids? What shops can I still use?"
163,193,Speaker 3,F,00:57:28,"And if you're using a walking stick, you've got less."
164,194,Speaker 2,F,00:57:32,"Yeah, yeah. And if you live remotely, sort of away from the city even harder because. You know, if you can't drive anymore. They're not necessarily bus services to where you want to go, when you want to go there. I said that makes it even harder as well. I mean, we've got like one little village shop we sell basic things, but they are expensive. Yeah, exactly. So, you know, like half a dozen eggs is just over two pounds woo. So again, if you want, you know, just a state pension, you know you going to be compromising your health because you you're doing without things. Because, yeah, because of that, you know? Yeah, I save the boiler break down. Heat is more important to you may be than have been a loaf of bread or some milk. I don't know. You know, you've prioritising what you do and don't need, isn't it?"
165,195,Speaker 2,F,00:58:37,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, they were struggling during the pandemic, weren't they?"
166,196,Speaker 4,F,00:58:41,"For me, I like to go shopping myself, I hope not never happens to me because I love shopping."
167,197,Speaker 2,F,00:58:51,"I like I like to my own food. Yes, because my my menu for the however long I've done my shopping is based on what I buy. Yeah. And if so, I'll be getting the bargains. Yes. Yes, special offers. And then that takes what you're making for the rest of the month."
168,199,Speaker 4,F,00:59:11,"Lots of shops have shut down, like Debenhams, I'm gutted because I love that shop."
169,200,Speaker 3,F,00:59:18,"With  home delivery you've got to rely on the products being good, especially fresh products."
170,201,Speaker 4,F,00:59:27,"When you are in the supermarket, you see them going around with these big trollies and they just go on like they're picking it off the shelves."
171,202,Speaker 3,F,00:59:34,"Yeah, I'm checking the day of expiry."
172,203,Speaker 1,F,00:59:37,"I'm too fussy. I'm one of these people that if there's a row of them, it's like not the first one."
173,204,Speaker 1,F,00:59:43,"And yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody's gonna take the first one. I have to get one from around the back. You know, I might go and shop and think I'm going to make beef stew today, and then I go in the shop and something else is more reasonable, or catches my eyes. So yeah,"
174,205,Speaker 2,F,00:59:59,"yeah, it's exactly what I do."
175,207,Speaker 2,F,01:00:04,"Yeah, yeah, it's what it's sort of"
176,208,Speaker 4,F,01:00:06,"clearance. I like to look at bargains. Yeah, yeah. Well, I buy some good stuff."
177,209,Speaker 3,F,01:00:14,"You can put it in the freezer, can't you?"
178,210,Speaker 1,F,01:00:16,"Yeah, I have had deliveries before, and what I found difficult is the guy comes to the door and dumps it down on the floor. And then you know that he's on a really short timescale. You know, he's got to turn around in so many seconds and and he's kind of like, you know, get your and get your shopping and you're like, Oh, really stressed that I'm going to kind of like yank everything out of this thing, and I wouldn't like somebody to come into the house and be just chucking stuff. Yeah, and then rushing off. So yeah, I don't know."
179,212,Speaker 1,F,01:00:50,"Yeah, we've given you this instead. Did I ask for that? No. Why are you giving me that?  How is that helpful?"
180,214,Speaker 1,F,01:01:07,"Also, I think food shopping is quite personal, isn't it? Yeah."
181,215,Speaker 3,F,01:01:11,And it's another way of socialising. You get to see people.
182,216,Speaker 4,F,01:01:14,"Yeah, but the thing is, if you live on your own, you've got to spend a certain amount for it to be delivered."
183,217,Speaker 4,F,01:01:22,Yeah. So get five over twenty five or whatever.
184,218,Speaker 4,F,01:01:26,"Yeah, well, yes, that's right. I was born out of food and you're not going to necessarily be using that. Yeah. Have you ever looked in somebody else's shopping basket or trolley and been quite judgemental umm? Laughs"
185,219,Speaker 4,F,01:01:38,Yeah.
186,220,Speaker 1,F,01:01:40,"And sometimes if I've got something in my shop, I always feel guilty. If I'm buying a bottle of wine, you know, my local co-op, I was like,"
187,221,Speaker 2,F,01:01:46,Does anybody know?
188,222,Speaker 1,F,01:01:47,Yeah. And then I think I want to hold it up and go low alcohol. Laughs
189,223,Speaker 2,F,01:01:51,"Okay, maybe. It's eight o'clock in the morning and I need it...Laughs"
190,226,Speaker 2,F,01:03:13,"I think everybody would have internet, wouldn't they? I keep saying that in our village when the like the parish council say well they can find on the web pages, maybe they don't use internet. Yeah, yeah."
191,227,Speaker 4,F,01:03:24,"Yeah, I mean, like, are we talking about when we are going to be that age where I know how to do the internet, but I'm not great at it. I get by. But like, like my mother, she's in her 80s. She's blind. She does know nothing. We bought a mobile phone. She couldn't use it!"
192,228,Speaker 4,F,01:03:49,It's worth some help as well. Yeah. Asking somebody.
193,229,Speaker 1,F,01:03:52,"So that's about socialisation, isn't it?"
194,230,Speaker 3,F,01:03:53,"Yes, for the knowledge somebody that's using whatever. It's like a social service or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. So something would know, if they're using their facilities.."
195,232,Speaker 2,F,01:04:08,It's like a community group .
196,233,Speaker 1,F,01:04:12,"So, you're looking for the physical things, you know?"
197,234,Speaker 1,F,01:04:19,"So for me, I don't know about other people, but for me, one of the big problems is the actual physicality of the house that I live in. Keeping it in good repair and suitable for me."
198,235,Speaker 2,F,01:04:31,"Yeah, maintenance."
199,236,Speaker 1,F,01:04:32,"So I don't know how to describe that. But yeah, and maintenance and adaptations for the property that I'm actually living in."
200,237,Speaker 2,F,01:04:40,"Yes, do you need help getting in and out of the bath and up the stairs?"
201,238,Speaker 2,F,01:04:58,"It could be, couldn't it?"
202,239,Speaker 1,F,01:05:10,Did we say much about transport as well?
203,240,Speaker 2,F,01:05:17,"We did mention it. Yeah, sort of loss the car, so you got loss of independence. If you ..."
204,242,Speaker 1,F,01:05:23,"Yeah, mm."
205,243,Speaker 3,F,01:05:33,I think knowledge.
206,244,Speaker 1,F,01:05:35,"I don't think that's a physical one, isn't it?"
207,246,Speaker 3,F,01:05:39,All right.
208,247,Speaker 1,F,01:05:39,"I think that's more like a social informational one, I think we are thinking about, you know, kind of bricks and mortar type of .., you know, the physical environment around us"
209,248,Speaker 4,F,01:05:49,"Being able to do your own shopping, if you couldn't do your own shopping. That's a big one for me."
210,249,Speaker 2,F,01:06:05,That you're physically being able to go and do it yourself.
211,251,Speaker 1,F,01:06:24,"Yeah, so it's a physical capability."
212,253,Speaker 1,F,01:06:43,"And maybe it's something more like run regular newsletters, regular updates, community centres which are very physical in the sense of, if those if those people like us actually community workers, age concern. Yeah, yeah, you know, housing provider,."
213,254,Speaker 3,F,01:07:02,They would know a lot of...
214,255,Speaker 1,F,01:07:05,The kind of the physical environment if those agencies like.
215,257,Speaker 2,F,01:07:12,"It's like the GP surgeries, they know the demographics to be able to..."
216,259,Speaker 2,F,01:07:36,"And if that makes your life easier by knowing it, that you know that you could get sort of grab handles to get the door, you know, if you were struggling with your front door would, you know it's just yeah."
217,260,Speaker 3,F,01:07:50,I think information is important because there's a lady that moved into the wrong house and she realised that the heating was in with the bill.
218,261,Speaker 1,F,01:07:59,Oh bless her!
219,262,Speaker 3,F,01:07:59,"So she was freezing cold all through the winter. She had to go to hospital for hypothermia. You know, she was really in a bad way because she didn't get information"
220,263,Speaker 1,F,01:08:10,and she was frightened to put it on?
221,264,Speaker 3,F,01:08:12,"Yeah, because it was extra money, she didn't realise. So that's why I'm talking about, information ...I told her go and ask in the end."
222,265,Speaker 1,F,01:08:32,"But we all obviously ...yeah, we didn't do a good job by explaining that that to her. Obviously, and again, I guess.."
223,266,Speaker 3,F,01:08:40,"It's also the maintenance of the House isn't it? yeah, because keeping it warm."
224,267,Speaker 1,F,01:09:23,So helpful gadgets. I love a gadget.
225,268,Speaker 3,F,01:09:31,"Did you meet my sister when she came down? Um yeah. She she got loads of stuff because obviously from the hospital, all the doctors, you know, she got a social worker to come to see her, and that's how she found out. She got lots of stuff."
226,269,Speaker 1,F,01:09:52,"Yeah, so gadgets, adaptations for actually physically help you stay in the same environment"
227,270,Speaker 4,F,01:09:59,"and help keep your independence, doesn't it? Yeah."
228,271,Speaker 1,F,01:10:04,"And having a handrail for up, yeah, versus moving home. Yeah, such a quick win."
229,272,Speaker 3,F,01:10:10,"I've got all that in my flat already. Because the person who lived there before me was in a wheelchair, so ..."
230,273,Speaker 1,F,01:10:28,"Cats, yes. Love cats."
231,274,Speaker 3,F,01:10:30,"They're dangerous when you get older, trip over. My one sent me down the stairs because you know when you go down stairs I don't go straight I go like this. I tried to avoid him, top to bottom, boom. Oh, so that's why my back is..."
232,275,Speaker 1,F,01:10:46,Did you get rid of your cat after that?
233,276,Speaker 3,F,01:10:49,"No, no. Laughs"
234,277,Speaker 1,F,01:10:50,See because you love your cat.
235,279,Speaker 1,F,01:10:53,"and they that they are the best company. Yeah, yeah."
236,280,Speaker 1,F,01:11:00,"And I found after my cat died that I felt that I had nothing to care for and no routine in my life left because it was like I would get all she would be where is my breakfast. Hmm. So I had that routine of. And it kind of took me out of me because I had to do something for something else. You know, I had to always be thinking of something something else. You know, and there was a company routine. That sense of"
237,282,Speaker 1,F,01:11:33,"Yes, yes, exactly. So I found it really hard when she died because I just felt like the house felt like a house not a home and I felt like something was really missing. And I really struggled to to find a routine or something to do that wasn't just about me. Yeah."
238,284,Speaker 1,F,01:11:56,November.
239,286,Speaker 1,F,01:12:00,"I want to. But Rob is not ready yet. He says, .."
240,288,Speaker 3,F,01:12:07,Yeah. We will get you a little kitten.
241,289,Speaker 3,F,01:12:09,and that's what I want to get a kitten.
242,290,Speaker 3,F,01:12:12,"Yeah. Well, I'm not one allowed the pets, so yeah, but I wouldn't have another pet."
243,291,Speaker 1,F,01:12:17,And I think that's really difficult..
244,292,Speaker 3,F,01:12:19,Because it's tying as well.
245,293,Speaker 4,F,01:12:21,"You can go on birthday now, you can go away. You haven't got to worry about somebody looking after that more."
246,294,Speaker 3,F,01:12:29,That's the problem I had when I moved to the Barbican.
247,295,Speaker 3,F,01:12:35,"Well, yeah. But yeah, they are too tying, I mean, because my mother's not well and it's hard. To get up there when you have to, but I've got good neighbours who look look after her."
248,296,Speaker 1,F,01:12:52,"Yeah, but I think again, pets may become more important when you can't go long distances you when maybe you're not travelling. So much and you know you're on your own for longer periods of time."
249,297,Speaker 3,F,01:13:06,"I'm just waiting when Kirsty gets home, she's getting a dog, so I'll dog sit my grand-dog. Yeah, Liam's got born. But obviously he's up in Manchester."
250,298,Speaker 3,F,01:13:29,"Another one is stairs lift, because a lot of people live in two story house or whatever, so stair lift would be a physical adaptation. Would it be in the mobility, stairs lift? because it is mobile, to take you upstairs and bring you down."
251,301,Speaker 1,F,01:14:02,"But I'm thinking that pets are very important to people. Certainly would be, it would get more and more important."
252,302,Speaker 4,F,01:14:10,"Yeah. And dogs, dogs and cats, they sense when you're unhappy, so"
253,303,Speaker 1,F,01:14:21,"And a cat says I don't care. Yeah, you're unhappy, oh yeah, whatever."
254,304,Speaker 3,F,01:14:30,Dogs are more reliant on the owners and cats are more dependent on us.
255,305,Speaker 1,F,01:14:36,"And I suppose if you have something like a dog, as long as you don't have a massive great big dog, then that feeds into the exercise, you've got a rason to go out to push yourself to exercise."
256,306,Speaker 3,F,01:14:56,"Yeah, that's right. Spaces, parks. Yeah, yeah. Lots of well-being, isn't it?"
257,307,Speaker 4,F,01:15:01,"Yeah. Well, I live on the Barbican, so I've got everything there, green space, the sea, rubbish, too, Yeah, seagulls. Laughs"
258,309,Speaker 3,F,01:16:14,"The other thing is, I find supermarkets don't cater of single people. So you have to buy big, don't you? I don't need to buy big tins, I want small tins. So tomatoes and things like that. So it's not necessarily catered for single people."
259,310,Speaker 4,F,01:16:35,"Yeah, you can. You can buy small tins, but sometimes it's cheaper to buy a big tin, though."
260,311,Speaker 1,F,01:16:47,"But if you go to somewhere, like if you go on holiday and you, you go to a restaurant and it's just you. Yeah, it's a very uncomfortable experience to sit in a coffee shop by yourself. Yeah. To sit in a restaurant. Oh yes. But I think it would be much know. I know some restaurants tried this. This is a table where somebody might come and say, I can't remember the expression, but somebody might come and sit and chat. And so I'm."
261,313,Speaker 1,F,01:17:16,"Yeah, it was a scheme and there was a notice on the table and it said something like this is a community coffee table and somebody might just come. And if you sit here, be prepared. Somebody else might come and sit here with you to chat. And I think there needs to be more of that kind of thing because if you don't get to see anybody, and you think well, I'll go out for a cup of coffee. You then feel like a good drinking go or I've got to pretend that I'm reading something because I'm"
262,314,Speaker 3,F,01:17:41,"The times I had to go and get something to eat, it's like.... so it would be nice just to"
263,315,Speaker 1,F,01:17:51,"Especially again, if it's difficult to cook at home for yourself, you don't feel like it to be able to go to places where you didn't. You didn't have this feeling that everybody was going, Oh no, no. Oh dear, on our own."
264,316,Speaker 3,F,01:18:08,"Also, I think as you get older, it's harder to make friends. Yes. Yeah, because your old friends, you know, might moved away or they passed away. Yeah, and all that sort of things. So, yeah, well, to make new friends, it's quite hard."
265,317,Speaker 4,F,01:18:24,"You know, I left my home, my family, my friends, over 30 years ago and when me and my ex-husband split up and moved to Plymouth and. Because my daughter was here, obviously, my eldest daughter was here already. And, um, yeah, I find it really, really hard. I was in my forties when I moved into Plymouth, and I did find it really, really hard considering I had a lot of friends in the army environment. It was just like a big family. And so I left home, moved to that. All my friends are in Sutherland, my best friends, the people I grew up with, family also."
266,318,Speaker 1,F,01:19:15,"I think also if you lose a partner, with a divorce or they die, then you often lose half of your friends with that, you know, because."
267,319,Speaker 4,F,01:19:27,You lose half of the family.
268,320,Speaker 1,F,01:19:29,"Yeah. You know, you might as a couple. Yeah, their family. Yeah, you have their friends as well. Yeah. And that person isn't there for whatever reason. You suddenly just what? It might include things like grandchildren and things."
269,321,Speaker 4,F,01:19:42,"Yeah, yeah. My, you know, his for his family were very supportive of me. We were really, really close. But now, like the kids have got their own kids. So basically all I see is, well, I've got friends. Hazel's my friend. Yeah. Not that you've seen much of each other. I haven't. I've got my family. But sometimes it's just nice to."
270,323,Speaker 3,F,01:20:39,"Yeah, because of the care home system as well."
271,324,Speaker 4,F,01:20:43,"Yeah, I do see my family there. They would be there for me to drop of the heart if I needed them, but I need them to meet me. Yeah."
272,325,Speaker 1,F,01:20:54,"So, I don't have any family left living. So, it's me, that's the end. But I think there's a lot of prejudice about older people. You know, there's a lot of assumptions about older people about, you know, for example, if I'm putting on an activity and somebody saying I'll put some music on and they say we can find some war songs and I'm like, How old do you think these people are?"
273,326,Speaker 1,F,01:21:19,"Oh, you know, yeah. Laughs. They were probably in the teens listening to this stuff in the sixties. Yeah, yeah. There's this idea that once you hit 50, you know you want to talk about the war. You want to, you knind of..."
274,327,Speaker 3,F,01:21:36,mention Elvis Presley. You say ...Laughs
275,328,Speaker 1,F,01:21:41,"you know,and because you've hit a certain age certainly, physically you've deteriorated, mentally  you've deteriorated, and"
276,329,Speaker 4,F,01:21:48,"all my children were brought up listening to Disco. I love Disco, but my grandchildren, then probably one they'll grow up, I don't probably think..., it's horrible music. I mean, some of the music my children like, I like, you know,."
277,330,Speaker 1,F,01:22:10,"But you're not allowed to. Do you know what I mean? In the sense? Yeah, because you're older. Yeah, yeah. You're not allowed to like that music or you're not allowed to like these clothes, you know, why are you shopping in that shop buying those clothes? You should be down at Marks and Spencers? buying something suitable for your age."
278,332,Speaker 3,F,01:22:49,"Yeah, I think when I was young, the eldest was the boss and all that changed in that quite annoys me. Yeah, yeah, that is right. Yes."
279,333,Speaker 1,F,01:23:01,"That is interesting that you say that, you know, because as you get older, you find that the people who are telling you what to do at work, are actually quite a lot younger than you. And you're like, ummm! Laughs"
280,334,Speaker 3,F,01:23:13,"Oh, yeah, you know, I even now I respect my mother, you know, if she says, you do this, you do it. Yeah. But now it's like. So it's just I mean, I know I'm only 61 year old, but it is like losing control. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The kids rule the roost, not the adults."
281,336,Speaker 3,F,01:23:43,"I know, I know ..Laughs."
282,337,Speaker 3,F,01:23:43,"The other thing I find is I'm not good on technology. I'm not there at all. I don't just let it go. Yeah. And you're trying to ask your daughter, Tell me, why do you do it yourself? Try it yourself. Yeah. You know, that's it."
283,338,Speaker 3,F,01:24:02,"That's that's another thing. It's a barrier. Yeah. I think to older people, it's a technology thing. I think it's sleeping us the airlines. Yeah. You know, banking is going to be online. All this sort of stuff now going to be everything. Yeah. And also the other thing you know, you can get done on the phone at a certain age, you know.."
284,339,Speaker 3,F,01:24:26,"Rotten phone calls, you know, trying to get money out"
285,340,Speaker 1,F,01:24:29,"Oh, scammers?"
286,341,Speaker 3,F,01:24:30,"Yes, scammers, that sort of things. So you don't understand that. I think that's enough environmental problem."
287,343,Speaker 3,F,01:24:40,"Because nobody properly talks to each other anymore, do they? That's always on the phone. Yeah. You know, so you can say nasty things to people that you don't see their feelings? Hmm. Face to face. So you could get all that as well. So that could terrify an old person, you know?"
288,344,Speaker 1,F,01:24:57,"Yeah, I get the other thing, because I'm quite OK with technology. Yeah, I was in a coffee shop one day, it seems to spend an awful lot on coffee shops, and the app wasn't working. And I said to the go at the counter, Oh, I can't get my points. The app isn't working and she said you have to have the app and I'm like, I've got the app. Do you know how it works? My love and I'm like what? Why do you talk ...Of course it's just not working. And it was because she saw that I was older. My hair was grey. She immediately assumed, that I didn't know how to use the app. No, it's just not working. It's not that I don't know how to use it."
289,345,Speaker 3,F,01:25:39,"Yeah, to me Hazel, you look really young, you know,."
290,346,Speaker 1,F,01:25:43,"Oh, thank you."
291,347,Speaker 3,F,01:25:43,"But I've said that to you in the past,."
292,348,Speaker 1,F,01:25:45,And maybe I was having a bad day. Laughs.
293,349,Speaker 1,F,01:25:49,"Yes, she was, exactly. Really condescending. She was raising her voice. She was speaking very clearly ..."
294,350,Speaker 1,F,01:26:05,"I think I found it quite upsetting because it reminded me that I am to other people what I see is not what other people see. And there was this assumption that I might end up missing out on things or being treated in a different way because people have made a judgement about me. Just, you know, we've decided that you're an old person and you're not capable. So we're not going to even offer you this opportunity to do something."
295,351,Speaker 3,F,01:26:35,"When I get on the bus with a younger person, gets up, sit down, Idon't want to sit down and stand up here. Laugh."
296,352,Speaker 4,F,01:26:46,"I still get up for an eldery person to give them my seat. But you see these people come and just sat there and an old lady over old man gets on and the won't move. Yeah, and there is me getting up."
297,353,Speaker 1,F,01:27:07,"But it's in the media, isn't it? If somebody either in the negative, they get attacked in the street or, you know, somebody does something. They run a marathon. If it's somebody under the age of 50, they just run a marathon and they just got mugged. Once you pass 50s, they deal, you know, 73 got mugged. Or, you know, amazing man. 81 run a marathon. It's like this whole thing in our culture."
298,354,Speaker 3,F,01:27:35,"Yeah, I've been mugged. It's not nice."
299,355,Speaker 1,F,01:27:36,"No I know I can imagine that, you know, people have this perception without really thinking about what people are like at certain age."
300,356,Speaker 3,F,01:27:46,That could not give confidence.
301,357,Speaker 1,F,01:27:48,"Exactly. And and then that makes you start thinking, do I need to be, you know, in a more supported environment? Am I safe? Do I want to go out? yeah."
302,358,Speaker 1,F,01:28:01,"Yeah, very frightening!"
303,359,Speaker 4,F,01:28:24,"Plymouth community homes are brilliant. Yes, they are. You know, you can't fault them, even though sometimes some certain people put them down. Mentioning no names Hazel, you probably know who I am talking about. But yeah, they are really good."
304,360,Speaker 3,F,01:28:52,"The person, the person who wants to know without asking? Because if you don't ask, you're not going to learn. Yeah, yeah. But if they don't know the people, they're not going to help you. Yeah. So it's down to the person or the family. Yeah."
305,361,Speaker 4,F,01:29:08,"Yeah, I think because you get to when you first move in you get a booklet, all the dos, the don'ts, the waht's on. Yeah, I think that's really helpful. Yeah, but I reckon this lady didn't know she should have been told that because when I moved in then told me, well, when I went to look at the property then told me everything that I have to pay. Yeah. And what the payment was for. Yeah. So I can't understand why that lady wasn't told."
306,362,Speaker 4,F,01:29:45,Yeah. So why would she sit in the cold?
307,364,Speaker 3,F,01:29:57,"yeah, yeah, because you're new to the place you're frightened. I suppose you'd get worried to ask other people, you don't know them. Yeah. And everything else. Yeah. You know,."
308,365,Speaker 1,F,01:30:05,Why would she sit in the cold?
309,366,Speaker 3,F,01:30:07,"I thought had her cover over, but still not enough, because she had not wanted to come out with us either?"
310,367,Speaker 3,F,01:30:12,"Yeah. You know, so her blood blood was low, but I don't know why."
311,368,Speaker 4,F,01:30:17,People would they put the heating on. I can't understand why she wouldn't put the heating on.
312,369,Speaker 3,F,01:30:21,"No, because she thought she had to pay extra on top of it."
313,370,Speaker 4,F,01:30:25,"Oh, I see."
314,371,Speaker 3,F,01:30:26,"She wasn't told the heating was included. She wasn't told, so she thought she had to pay extra on top to keep the place warm."
315,373,Speaker 1,F,01:31:01,"And also maybe some more things where people are encouraged to mix through ages. Yeah, because, you know, some intergenerational stuff where we're and I don't mean that patronising thing where very young people come with a basket of food..."
316,374,Speaker 3,F,01:31:16,"I love mixing with the elderly, even though I'm"
317,375,Speaker 1,F,01:31:19,"yeah, but I think we should do things like lunch clubs that have a whole, you know, anybody is welcome to come, because I think once you start saying this is for you because you're a certain age and you go to this and you don't go to the that again just reinforces a lot of this kind of ."
318,377,Speaker 1,F,01:31:38,Yeah. Absolutely.
319,378,Speaker 3,F,01:31:39,"I think we are lucky ourselves for the generation we're in now, because 60, 20 years ago, would be the old age, wouldn't it? You know, we're talking about sixty looking after older people. Yeah, it seems weird, you know? Yeah, I'm scrapping at 60, all those years back. So we're lucky because we've got the infrastructure, the free national health and all sort of things which they wouldn't have, you know, so we are lucky that way, and that's why I think we're living longer. So there is more for us, yeah, than it was in the past. You know, there were care homes in those days"
320,379,Speaker 4,F,01:32:18,"But th thing in the past, everything was, it's like, you know, this plastic pollution? Yeah. You know, you never got anything in plastic bags when I was young. Everything was in paper bags."
321,380,Speaker 4,F,01:32:32,"Yeah, I used to get grease proof paper to wrap your ham and then put it in a brown paper bag. Yeah. So now, more stuff I know, they're trying to stop that, but that was in my generation."
322,381,Speaker 1,F,01:32:57,"And that is definitely a physical barrier. Yeah, yeah. Plastic packaging on some fruits these days. When you're trying to pull it off, and it just won't go ."
323,382,Speaker 3,F,01:33:01,"Especially with the arthritis in your hands, right?"
324,383,Speaker 1,F,01:33:09,"Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty funny. Put it back in paper bags please."
325,385,Speaker 4,F,01:33:17,"I wouldn't, I couldn't live without a telly."
326,386,Speaker 1,F,01:33:20,"So when you say TV, do you mean like the regular channels or do you mean like things like Netflix, prime?"
327,388,Speaker 4,F,01:33:32,"It's a it's a noise. Yeah. Well, even if you're not really taking in, it's the noise in the background. I was talking,"
328,389,Speaker 1,F,01:33:38,"Yeah, my tell is on all the time. Yeah, watching it. That's just going on news just in the background."
329,391,Speaker 1,F,01:33:48,"Oh, that's so funny."
330,393,Speaker 3,F,01:34:13,We've got staff. We've got staff. We can get in contact with.
331,394,Speaker 4,F,01:34:18,"My children, Yeah, because obviously I haven't got that."
332,395,Speaker 3,F,01:34:22,"I've got only one child in Plymouth, my other two are in London."
333,396,Speaker 4,F,01:34:25,"Yeah, I've got two daughters, so my daughters and I think when I get old, I'll have my granddaughters as well. So if my daughters can't do it my granddaughters will do it all of this,."
334,397,Speaker 1,F,01:34:39,"So, if Rob wasn't there, I'd have no one at all."
335,398,Speaker 3,F,01:34:42,You got me here.
336,399,Speaker 1,F,01:34:44,"Yeah, I'll ring you up. I would say, Come Christine and help me."
337,400,Speaker 3,F,01:34:48,"Yeah, as I said, where we are. Everybody keeps an eye out for everyone else so that simply not what we'd knock on the door. You know, so."
338,401,Speaker 4,F,01:34:58,"You know, some people don't want to make friends. Don't want to get on with the neighbours. Hmm. So but, where I live, all my friends, all in the 70s, most of them are"
339,402,Speaker 3,F,01:35:12,Yeah. So you can really rely on the younger generation to look after us when we get older. Yeah. Yeah.
340,403,Speaker 4,F,01:35:20,I know my children will be there for me. Yeah.
341,404,Speaker 1,F,01:35:23,"So have the people enjoyed doing the Zoom and message calls, you know, the video calls?"
342,405,Speaker 4,F,01:35:28,Yeah. I did.
343,407,Speaker 3,F,01:35:31,"Yes. Yeah, I do. Yeah, in a group like this, it's lovely."
344,408,Speaker 1,F,01:35:33,Is that because you prefer face to face generally or because you find the technology aggravating?
345,409,Speaker 3,F,01:35:41,"No, I I find it rude sometimes."
346,411,Speaker 3,F,01:35:49,"I just got a little while. My tablet like that, this little screen."
347,413,Speaker 1,F,01:35:58,"Because I found I actually really loved the first lockdown because there was so much online that I would never, ever have been able to access before. It was just like Aladdin's cave for me. Just being able to to go online and people were teaching things, giving away, you know, content with so much going on that you could get involved."
348,415,Speaker 1,F,01:36:28,"No, no, you wouldn't."
349,417,Speaker 1,F,01:36:32,"I did dance classes with people in Australia. Last week, I did a ballet class at the Royal Ballet School. You know, I never, ever. I take weekly lessons with a lady in London, and I'm just about to start taking weekly lessons with the guy in Washington."
350,419,Speaker 1,F,01:36:53,"Ballet classes in Washington, D.C."
351,421,Speaker 1,F,01:36:57,"Yes, I have got a bar. Yeah, yeah, I've got a bar. But no, I don't have a mirror. I don't want a mirror."
352,422,Speaker 1,F,01:37:13,"But we also we've got a social group with a group of dancers in Germany where they have the floods. Oh yeah, a couple of weeks ago in Koblenz. And so, you know, we were able to kind of check that those ladies were OK and give them a bit of support and encouraging them."
353,423,Speaker 3,F,01:37:29,"Yeah. But when you get when you get older as well, your eyesight is not so good you could have cataracts or whatever. This order is going to be not good. So we need to hear people. Don't you to talk?"
354,424,Speaker 1,F,01:37:44,"But hopefully, medicine is advancing as much technologically wise as as everything else. Hopefully, by the time we have cataracts, it will be this afternoon having cataracts done and off you pop."
355,425,Speaker 4,F,01:37:59,Hopefully.
356,426,Speaker 1,F,01:37:59,I will ever hopefully.
357,427,Speaker 3,F,01:38:03,"Well, I hope I won't get what my mum's got, macular degeneration. She'll never be able to see again. No, she can see. But she had a cataracts off. That was really the won't take them off until they're deep. Yeah."
358,428,Speaker 1,F,01:38:20,"So I'm hoping to be like Steve Austin, the six Million Dollar Man. I'll just have them replaced."
359,429,Speaker 3,F,01:38:38,"She had a cataract off, and she can see close. Everything was black before she got this cataract  gone, off a few weeks ago, and she can see colours now. So I think she's it's still like fuzzy."
360,430,Speaker 1,F,01:38:52,"That is a little bit of a worry. You know, will the National Health Service still be here? Yeah. Well, we're older, you know? You know, that's a that's a scary thing because I've I've only known the health service, you know, and I've, I've, you know, benefited."
361,431,Speaker 3,F,01:39:13,"My my sister's a carer, but she's up in Sunderland up in the Northeast. And obviously, I live here now, so I don't take her. But I speak to her most of the time and I speak to her every day. If I'm home but if I'm at my daughters, which is a lot. I spend half of my time at my daughter. But yeah, yeah, no, I'm not a carer. Yeah, it's like being a mother again."
362,432,Speaker 1,F,01:39:47,"Yeah. You mentioned something earlier about dementia. Yeah. And saying that, you know, if you've got dementia again, all of this is going to go is going to go is going to go, you've lost. Yeah. That's what all of your social connections, because unfortunately, you know, mentally, you're not able to ..."
363,433,Speaker 4,F,01:40:06,"your memory is not that good either. So you could have to rely on somebody that's just said to be able to go online for banking and everything else. And if we can't go online, then we're in trouble, you know?"
364,434,Speaker 4,F,01:40:36,"Yes, family."
365,436,Speaker 4,F,01:40:39,"Yeah, well, I've got my church family. So they would be called family."
366,437,Speaker 1,F,01:40:45,"Yes, firends, family. so I guess family in the widest sense. Yes."
367,438,Speaker 4,F,01:40:49,"Yes, because you can choose your friends. Yes, yes. Friends can become family."
368,439,Speaker 1,F,01:40:54,People you are most close to
369,443,Speaker 4,F,01:41:21,"Yeah, I do. Laughs watching too much.."
370,444,Speaker 4,F,01:41:41,"Yeah, I find it fabulous. There is  these quizzes and all that sort of things, and it keeps working on. Yeah. And everything else. I think that's the physical aspect of it."
371,445,Speaker 1,F,01:41:56,"But like you said earlier, I think there's that sense of if you're in the house with no sound of any description or you feel lonely. Yeah, even if you've got the television on the radio or something, on the background, you don't notice the silence. You don't noticeit by yourself."
372,446,Speaker 3,F,01:42:10,"And I keep talking about my mother, for she likes to how, even though she can't see it, she likes to have the quizzes on. Yeah, you know, she watches the chase. Yeah. And what's the one before that, Tipping point? Yeah. And then so she can answer the questions yes, it keeps up the mind active. Even though she can't see it, she can hear it."
373,447,Speaker 1,F,01:42:39,"So we didn't really talk much about that kind of mental stimulation, did we? That is really important."
374,449,Speaker 3,F,01:43:09,"Yeah, because that could be depressing. When you can't get up and do things for yourself, like you used to"
375,451,Speaker 4,F,01:43:20,depression.
376,452,Speaker 4,F,01:43:24,If the people at church found out where I am.
377,454,Speaker 3,F,01:43:39,Facilitator.
378,455,Speaker 3,F,01:45:08,"I think the other one, I think as you get older, you lose your confidence."
