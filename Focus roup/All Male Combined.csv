0,0,0,Speaker 1,M,00:00:40,But my thoughts were to learn about technology now learning more about technology.
1,1,1,Speaker 2,M,00:00:50,"Um,. I'm not crazy technology, computers, even phones. I use my phone as a computer. I've got a laptop and a tablet about the use of make things right. So, um, that was it, really. And then I thought, Well, we'll learn something today."
2,2,2,Speaker 2,M,00:01:21,Yeah.
3,3,3,Speaker 1,M,00:02:04,"Very. And yeah, yeah."
4,5,5,Speaker 2,M,00:02:31,"It's about different disabilities in one way or another. Looking at the less on the forms so that was 50 percent of where we live. People has got different disabilities. Some people we see struggle and when I became disabled I thought, well, I could get worse as I got older and yeah, I want to be able to stay at home. You know, I don't want to be living in fear of people who live after me, or not being able to do things for yourself. And I think we all feel like that, you know?"
5,6,6,Speaker 4,M,00:03:10,"So that's the reason I came. I love my home. Yeah, I love where I live with my home is, and I came here in the hope that I can learn to stay there as long as I can. And I'd hate to be in a residential care home, for example. It just would not be my scene."
6,7,7,Speaker 4,M,00:03:36,I managed to be.
7,11,11,Speaker 2,M,00:04:04,My memories of being one's own boss. Yeah.
8,13,13,Speaker 2,M,00:04:29,"it's that you thought correctly correct? You remember, Bill? Yeah, he's in a care home and he is happy enough. But he's he doesn't see anybody. How come the people in and he was running a video of where we live? He was the light of everybody's life in the, you know, he knew everything about the Barbican and everything he could tell you. He's in his 90s. He could tell you everything. And he was always pleasant to listen to. Um, when you went to a care home, you didn't see a lot of people in the building. You got a coffee mornings when you got down, you know? And so he's got more commonly where he is for each of missiles. He misses his family because they all live north and. To me, I couldn't live like that. You know, so,"
9,15,15,Speaker 2,M,00:08:16,"daily activities, yes, it is"
10,18,18,Speaker 4,M,00:09:28,"It's little things that concern me to some extent, I mean, for example, one thing that concerns me is actually having a show of. Now, at the moment, with great difficulty, I might add, I can actually stand up in my best, but it's not easy to actually cross your leg over wow and stand up, but the council have put handrails, so you know, OK, hang on to them and I really appreciate that because without them, there's no way I could get into the best and little things like that I really appreciate. And I just wouldn't like to smell too much."
11,19,19,Speaker 2,M,00:10:19,"Yeah, I have a wheelchair. Yeah, which looks like the standard of the big wheel. Yeah, I have that in my shower room, so I transfer from one wheelchair to another looking out in the shower. I don't like it I would prefer to stand up. I've got bad shoulders and from trying to get the showering 100, you know, and you don't feel like you clean yourself as a proper boy but it is better than a bath. When I lost my leg, I was given one of the chairs a rise and fall from Millbrook. And that was great because then I could just raise myself up turn around the chair and put my feet down. That was from the bath. So I don't know if you've got one of them."
12,20,20,Speaker 4,M,00:11:08,I've got an ordinary bath
13,21,21,Speaker 2,M,00:11:10,ride to call when you put it in your bath.
14,22,22,Speaker 4,M,00:11:13,"Oh no, I got nothing in the bath except the best mate drive"
15,23,23,Speaker 2,M,00:11:29,"Yeah, I didn't know they existed till I got one. Yeah. And I thought. And anybody struggling to get in and out of a bath of bullying about slipping falling in the bath. I mean, say we really, for me, a period in my confidence that started off with a bench going across the bath and I nearly went headfirst into the touch. And so I was at seven. Not we're not going to forget, you know,"
16,24,24,Speaker 2,M,00:11:59,"that period of time where we moved when I moved to now. Most of us got wet rooms. I think there's only one fly out the 34. It's got a bath. And their ideal for us, even if you only want a walking yeah, like I say, I was given that wheel chair just sat on that and it is quite comfy cushions say, you know, it's great."
17,25,25,Speaker 2,M,00:12:47,Not for me?
18,26,26,Speaker 2,M,00:13:01,"Yeah, that that bothers me because I have neuropathy means so don't feel heat straight away. Um, when I moved back in, I'm now four years ago, I was in a wheelchair. I'm in my bedroom. Very rarely wore it. Don't do this impression, but the important hello worked for me. I didn't have open air fryer and a small hub that was great while I was in the chair that was worried about leaning forward, bending down to get to the Oven. And even now I can bend down. Sometimes I can lose me balance, so it didn't bother me. And I think as I got older, personally that does concern me. You know, I've I lost me there like that. Be it, then I wouldn't be cooking takeaways. Yeah."
19,27,27,Speaker 2,M,00:14:00,I like talking!
20,30,30,Speaker 2,M,00:14:27,"Oh, there will be no look area,."
21,31,31,Speaker 4,M,00:14:40,"Transport is probably one chance for trying to get in and out because they can't use buses or taxis because I have difficulty trying to get into a door had trouble getting your car, you know? Yeah, and quite tall. Not quite as you bend, I've got back and hip problem. I can't kind of move properly. It's difficult with me. So is transport is a an issue."
22,32,32,Speaker 1,M,00:15:06,"I'm glad you mentioned that because transport will be the top of my list. And the reason being that as long as I can get on a bus and I can celebrate it in a bus stop, I can see my children and one lives in Launceston. One lives in Woodbridge and two and a half hours on the bus. But the only problem I've got with buses are and get on the bus at the moment and get off. But. I've got a hopefully I can manage without a wee until I get to Bodmin."
23,33,33,Speaker 1,M,00:15:40,pretty soon because it stops them enough above me for me to get out and have a pea that I've got to tell you this too.
24,35,35,Speaker 2,M,00:16:19,"Yeah, I've already mentioned we're right. Yeah. You know, I've been since, you know, legally here."
25,36,36,Speaker 2,M,00:16:30,"It's no, definitely not. But um. I think it's a good way of being in contact with people in families. I know it's nice to be together, but with everything we've gone through, you know, on Zoom or other social media, you can be your messenger through Facebook and it is good you can see your family talking to, you know, um,"
26,38,38,Speaker 2,M,00:17:10,"thinking, Oh yeah."
27,40,40,Speaker 2,M,00:17:24,"I struggle with it when I thought I had to isolate, because that meant taking early last year was to say isolate for 14 days. I struggled to quell my scooter to try to avoid everybody. Well, no shops open in town show free travel around there, but it can get scary as well. And I think I'm more scared now than it was last year, and I think it's because of the understanding of it about both the Jabs obsessive test yourself twice a week. But we have a great community where we live. We're lucky, we're very lucky, and we all realise that, um, we had nobody had the infection or anything like that, you know, the virus. So and we do sit downstairs. I'm not in the community when we weren't allowed to use that, but it's still sitting in the main entrance. You know, I don't"
28,41,41,Speaker 2,M,00:18:23,"do or out in the courtyard, you know, so we had the communication wasn't too bad for us. But if you look what your own in your own house and I think you're more isolated than I think communication right through technology is in really, you know."
29,42,42,Speaker 1,M,00:18:43,"When some people can't drive a car, that's how you do notoriety before then. Once you try to ?  During lockdown I was stuck for two years. Yes. We just live in a bedroom and that's it is a shared house for four people. And I wouldn't go see it."
30,43,43,Speaker 2,M,00:19:09,"And I just don't think even though we've got a community, we do face to face just in our reality now. You know, while they are still things like, do they really, I don't know what we would have done 40 years ago. I really don't, you know, so"
31,52,52,Speaker 2,M,00:22:44,"They've been very good press so of. I mean, I'm not with them, but some the our residents are yeah. And you know, I mean, that struggle. I don't even have to pay for my prescriptions. I got a text message from Boots's chemist because of pain and your prescription is ready for collection and closes the book. The booth came back only 10 minutes, you know? Yeah. So our customer, so we've been lucky like that."
32,54,54,Speaker 2,M,00:23:16,"But I was with Lloyds in Devonport. Then when I moved, I told my doctor that my prescription is going to Boots. And at the start, I had to keep ringing up, ringing up, getting prescriptions that over now Boots supply for it, for me."
33,56,56,Speaker 2,M,00:23:38,"We won't now go back four years ago. You know, these are driving where we have all agreed for, you know what I need from when they need it. So, OK, OK."
34,58,58,Speaker 2,M,00:24:00,"I forgot how my Doctor looks like,."
35,61,61,Speaker 2,M,00:24:09,"and you know, especially with the chest problem, and it's a bit of a telephone consultation. And when I say it's a consultation, a conversation because you will only be hearing huh huh down the phone ..."
36,62,62,Speaker 2,M,00:24:23,from the phone down and you prevent even breathe.
37,65,65,Speaker 2,M,00:25:30,"Yeah, I do get annoyed, really, don't you all?"
38,67,67,Speaker 2,M,00:25:35,"Yeah, it is very hard for trying to communicate concretely for people. And I think that's where you get fed up. And I think some people just give up to try to communicate with them. The next thing to get electricity, to know why you're doing this, why are you doing that? And again, people get put under pressure. Well, you know, it's it's horrible. Yeah, it's I'm quite fortunate I do get your scam calls, you know, text messages from my provider BT. And if I'm not sure I ring BT up, you know, saggy pants and stuff like that, you know so well, a lot of people don't know how to do all lot, you know?"
39,68,68,Speaker 2,M,00:26:24,"I read about after quite a lot of our residents doing jobs for them and things like that. It's something in my nature. I would reward myself and I used to work for, Yeah, and I still do it now. You know, that's what keeps me going mentally. You know, without all that I don't know, I'll be there enough income of our party, you know?"
40,70,70,Speaker 2,M,00:27:22,"Yeah, that's it. Yeah."
41,72,72,Speaker 2,M,00:28:07,"to do something very plausible, the people very and I sometimes tell our residents like I've had this scam call, if you get a scam call or they're asking you to BT again, we say my payment last month hasn't gone through and they take my details. Well, I've checked my bank statement. I know that it was paid, so I didn't have to do anything else. I just blocked the numbers. But they come back with different numbers"
42,73,73,Speaker 2,M,00:28:37,oh they did
43,74,74,Speaker 2,M,00:28:38,"So it's it's never ended, and I don't think it will stop the way we're going to stop it."
44,75,75,Speaker 4,M,00:28:48,There is a way for these big companies don't want to.
45,76,76,Speaker 2,M,00:29:10,"You can't keep. Yes. Yeah. We have agreed to our place doing Taichi every Monday afternoon. I start doing it with them well, so a lot of them, our regulars, that they drifted off along with what your you can't be with the big group and this group called the Barbican legends, which there were a lot around the Barbican. They were coming in, doing this Taichi. It is very good for you."
46,77,77,Speaker 2,M,00:29:41,"And it's a great way of being able to meet up with people. But at the moment it is not right to do. Um, I think they started it again and"
47,78,78,Speaker 2,M,00:30:01,"Yeah, for now we can't."
48,79,79,Speaker 2,M,00:30:09,"That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah."
49,80,80,Speaker 4,M,00:30:12,"So if I can just just go back three spaces. Somebody mentioned television licences. Now there's no getting away from the fact that television is very important to elderly people who are confined to their own home. Yeah, now I'm 82 soon be 83, and I've got a TV licence because they stop the free ones. And this week, for example, I got a message to renew my television licence, and I haven't done so because I got so annoyed that the millions and millions of people have not even done last year's licence. And yet, so I think because it's so important that elderly people have the facility legally to watch television, it ought to be sorted out."
50,81,81,Speaker 2,M,00:30:57,"Yeah, I get mine to be renewed every year automatically, and I don't know why, because by the people I to."
51,82,82,Speaker 4,M,00:31:06,"I don't mind paying, but I do expect other people to expect other people to pay."
52,84,84,Speaker 2,M,00:31:17,"The repeat programmes, you could expect a double bill for your licence."
53,85,85,Speaker 4,M,00:32:28,"Well, we'll just make one comment on digital communication. I didn't actually comment when it was discussed. I use a zoom, a great deal and sometimes that as many as 400 people can go on Zoom sessions from around the world little corners of the world had never heard of."
54,86,86,Speaker 4,M,00:32:50,How do I use it?
55,87,87,Speaker 4,M,00:32:57,"I use it for groups of which I am myself a member and the worldwide groups, and I use it for church activities, which I am a member. And I also use it digitally for communicating with my children with a portal, which is a magic machine. I just make telephone calls by saying to the television, Please ring Harry and Harry's on the television."
56,88,88,Speaker 2,M,00:33:28,"I also wondered about that one. Well, I'd probably get it for my family. Well."
57,89,89,Speaker 4,M,00:33:32,"So having said that, I'm not keen on it if I think about it deeply because it really does eliminate social interaction. Person to person, yes. So although I'm spot on a bit of a coward in a way, I use it. But. The back of my head says I don't really agree with this."
58,91,91,Speaker 2,M,00:34:07,I would say the pope was there on a big TV screen. You can see the state that was behind the screen and completely look like you got real bad luck.
59,92,92,Speaker 4,M,00:34:19,I only got this because one of my kids bought it for Christmas.
60,93,93,Speaker 2,M,00:34:22,Yeah.
61,94,94,Speaker 2,M,00:34:24,"No, I think I said digital interaction. Um, communication is important, but there are still a lot of people that don't have that. They don't want to. You know, I'm. I got it for just over two years, and I'm still scratching the surface with it, um. People come to me and ask me. Because so wrong when we computed hello. No, but your son can work for the education services on I.T., you know? So, um, I'm more a practical person."
62,97,97,Speaker 2,M,00:36:29,"Do you think that a lot of people think a realise that you know about self-care, that is important"
63,100,100,Speaker 2,M,00:36:44,"same as activities, you know, even though it's essential to you. You know, I've got to have a bath. It's an activity or a shower. You know, it's an activity."
64,102,102,Speaker 2,M,00:37:01,"People say to me, Always enjoy what you do or enjoy doing what you do. I have got saving for life, and I'm fortunate to have that. Um? Well, so, I've seen people that hasn't, you know, people"
65,107,107,Speaker 4,M,00:38:30,"But I think the transport as a part of social interaction is vital. I mean, for example, I've got a son who's a copper in Launceston. Yeah. Now I'm going to hop on the bus right outside my door. No one from here to those tables that hop on the bus and I get off at Tesco's in Launceston, which is eight minutes for my son, he collects me in the car. Yeah, I'm just starting to get some of the best of Tesco's naturally, but"
66,108,108,Speaker 2,M,00:38:59,"then I'm fortunate I've got a car hold beloved for. I don't know what I do generally road some of the residents around to the garden centres that help yourself, you know, so I've got no taxis but waste money on taxis, you know that. So I enjoy getting out excuse to get out. And so that is important to me."
67,110,110,Speaker 2,M,00:39:27,"Yes, you are."
68,112,112,Speaker 2,M,00:39:50,"Yeah, yeah. Is there any approximation when you crashed on the bus I worked with was comedy, a nightclub, three buses in the depot."
69,113,113,Speaker 2,M,00:39:58,"So I burst in because the crowds in the way that I went because it felt I felt pressured to do that and put the post goes quiet because I do like to use to drive. I do reverse parking and they'll go, Oh, you know, the flashing to the side? Yeah, something out."
70,114,114,Speaker 1,M,00:40:19,"I don't know his picture post. You can't, you"
71,115,115,Speaker 1,M,00:40:24,"know, it's a self-drive 'cause people make up, they go off, right? And I had two arguments to have taxi drivers in Plymouth but I didn't hear. He started giving me a lot of, you know, doing that and I'll get off an engineering and technology made.You would think a lot about Typekit. I think more people are going to get hit by a car, but yeah,."
72,116,116,Speaker 2,M,00:40:48,"They are know what you're saying, but it's all about climate change and people have to suffer with climate change and not just because of climate change. Electric cars, like you said, they're very quiet. I've never stepped out looking the wrong way, but you know, you don't ever call me, you know, so there's no"
73,124,124,Speaker 4,M,00:42:44,"But it was a complete idiot or not. One thing I miss is my driving licence and I can't drive. And I just let it lapse, like living in France and Belgium, and I didn't need one because this is I just never one of  ..."
74,125,125,Speaker 4,M,00:45:26,"Yeah, we're getting my driving licence back. It is not impossible that they have a point because I'm insulin dependent diabetic and had four heart bypass. I have cancer twice. They take all these medical things into account. And because you're over 80 years , You wait for years to get your driving licence, which is really going to make it hard to just renewed your degree and wouldn't have any problems in this country."
75,126,126,Speaker 4,M,00:53:19,"When you think of how the world's changed in the past 80 years, it's just a man. Yeah, and frightening."
76,128,128,Speaker 2,M,00:53:29,"see these films that come out, you know, robots."
77,129,129,Speaker 4,M,00:53:41,"But a very Victorian upbringing wouldn't even have electric vehicle guests if that oil lamps, no wireless or anything like that."
78,130,130,Speaker 2,M,00:53:53,"it's kind of my generation now. You know, I mean, I can't imagine having a television since I was a toddler. But when microwave was coming you give me pause and think that now you feel like I can't give me that one?"
79,131,131,Speaker 4,M,00:54:11,"Well, my wife wouldn't have one she wouldn't use it to get the room microwave oven."
80,133,133,Speaker 2,M,00:54:19,"Well, I think we read you talk about radiation and not what you think. You find that you know what's going to happen."
81,135,135,Speaker 4,M,00:54:31,"So I went to my well, I spent most of her time in the spinning wheel to yeah, yeah, straight on the spinning room. And she was very well as well."
82,136,136,Speaker 4,M,00:54:41,"And frankly, that was"
83,137,137,Speaker 2,M,00:54:45,"in an antique shop in the day and the end of the old toys. You know, and it's just like this spring on it and this little bobbing on it, you know, it was kids entertainment. Then, you know, and then you try and get a kid now like you one of them night that five year old knows how to use a computer about the knowledge. And it's. Oh yes. So I do have dyslexia, you know, so I struggle with things and not very retellings have to be told this is what you've got to do. Something finished telling me I've forgotten the first part. You know, so I don't know what going to be like in seventy years. I've no idea."
84,138,138,Speaker 2,M,00:55:50,That that scares me. I want to run a self-drive car sitting in a car andI can't control the steering wheel which is moving along the motorway that terrifies me. I like to be in control.
85,139,139,Speaker 2,M,00:56:09,"Well, we are in a way because we, you know, somebody at the front and control. You know that because that is"
86,140,140,Speaker 4,M,00:56:18,You don't know that on the docklands light rail that drives itself.
87,141,141,Speaker 2,M,00:56:30,"Yeah. And when you talk about planes without pilots, I mean, I won't even go on a plane anyway, you know, with the pilot"
88,144,144,Speaker 2,M,00:57:02,"If I get in the left hand drive car. Yeah. Even though I know so many drive, you know where I'll be banging my feet on the floor when you go to a break and you just instinctively think you've been driving for a long time. Yeah. And I mean, even get my car out of an adapted factory to be left for the accelerator and the brake, and for 40 years I've been driving."
89,146,146,Speaker 2,M,00:57:31,It was easier than I thought.
90,148,148,Speaker 2,M,00:57:37,"What I did before I got the car, I got in touch with a driving school that caters for disabled people. And when I got in the car and I said, Look, I'll be driving this in seventy nine, I said. Now the problem, do not say anything about my driving this bad. Tell me, but I don't want to be criticised, you know, because you have old habits and drive you driving your own way. And I was a bit edgy, $40 a throw, and it was only a tiny little car, you know, and I thought, I'm going to do wheelies and I brake I brake too sharp, so I have to concentrate on that. Then the car got the Nissan Qashqai sitting in there. It looks massive extra to get it. OK, now driving that for a couple of weeks, I was nervous. Is that on the road? Because trying to get out of style where I live onto the main road and I'm waiting for traffic to grow. I've got a gap and I just hit it slightly too hard. We're spending trying to get out, but now no problem."
91,151,151,Speaker 2,M,00:59:26,"Yeah, I've done that. Come up, take Pulling away the automatic changed gear."
92,153,153,Speaker 2,M,00:59:40,"it was the first time I drove an automatic car. Not adapted. Yeah, not a standard automatic car wasn't concentrated as it pulled away before it went to the clutch. I hit the foot brake. Yeah, I mean, by the way, through the windscreen fortunate to the seatbelt umm"
93,154,154,Speaker 2,M,01:00:04,"Oh, well, then you go on that. Yeah, it was just  you're naturally link stink when you're driving. In some betting. You can just get in the car. You don't think about anything. You can get and off you go, All right. And again, with all that I'm going off to Manchester in a couple of weeks. Yeah, I've never been further than IKEA Exeter and looked a bit nervous on the A38 driving fast I don't know why. I mean, there's going to be in Manchester I don't know how how many times it's just one go basically."
94,156,156,Speaker 2,M,01:00:55,"Yeah, well, I've got mobility scooter that I use in town quite a lot you know, but I'll throw in the big free cash flow and."
95,157,157,Speaker 1,M,01:01:04,I've got an ability scooter as well. Things I don't know. I would have come on that today ...
96,158,158,Speaker 2,M,01:01:17,"Well, that's it. I've got daily fit to motorbike change. So when I finally managed to keep my scooter outside anyway, I'll change it off. yeah. even if it just showed a sign outside the shop that changed to that, you know? Yes, I've been very fortunate to have the ..."
97,159,159,Speaker 2,M,01:03:28,"The other robot brought was a cat. It was a cat seating on your lap. We have to right be outside TG. This is nine to nine this is not what the carer describes it's coming back...She wanted to buy it. So she wanted to buy it. That was a hundred sixty pounds. Other robot like this you did with Astro came in and said...Well, she locked the cap and she wanted it to buy it. And she says to Hazel I've got the money here and I'll give you the money  laughs it's safe to. They give it to Eric. He can sort it...laughs"
98,160,160,Speaker 4,M,01:04:17,"I know, a bit of a dinosaur. I'm quite frightened for the future over there. Well, I think technology has advanced far too rapidly."
99,161,161,Speaker 2,M,01:04:26,"Well, I think that's probably where a lot of people struggle with it. Either don't do that and I don't put PCH a big grade with doing the computer courses where they but there's a lot of places on the dome, but you got to pay to go and it can be very expensive. So,."
100,163,163,Speaker 2,M,01:04:54,"No, no. I mean, I always felt well, not always but recently the PCH felt a bit get a bit too controlling over us now. Yeah. When the rules change because of covid, we don't get told until a month after and we have a lot of us are desperate to get back to the coffee mornings and the bingo afternoon we can use the community room. We can't just use the kitchen. And I said, Well, Bring your coach down for tea and coffee, you know? And I'm borrowing a cow out in the courtyard. Oh, OK. A lot more can carry hot drinks on their own, you know, so they I got so oh, you can't do that."
101,165,165,Speaker 2,M,01:06:09,"Yeah, right. I've got a cup holder which clips up the week and the wheelchair."
102,167,167,Speaker 2,M,01:06:16,"And I got it with a thermal cup. So the thermal cup  will fit in there. You can buy them. Usually Because you can adjust, you can adjust the the whole, you know, the the clip on it. Um, whether they want that, I don't know. I mean, if you was a guy, I've got thermal cups mine are that old now. No, they don't overheat that much. Um, but like you said, talking to my sister last night, she said, Well, you know, I thought if we got thermal cups then you can bring it down, a lot of them got what they call them..."
103,168,168,Speaker 2,M,01:07:12,"What we're saying is, you know, like, maybe this was a sale in the courtyard. A lot of them can't bring hot drinks down. I've suggested they put the the tea and the coffee in their own cups bring it down now, Boiler Co in the courtyard. But Debbie said, No, you can't do that. Do that. I don't understand why. Well, yeah."
104,169,169,Speaker 2,M,01:09:28,I've got about anybody else.
105,171,171,Speaker 1,M,01:10:26,I didn't quite understand what this door is.
106,173,173,Speaker 1,M,01:10:50,"Yeah, I understand."
107,176,176,Speaker 2,M,01:12:21,"answerable now like the zoom. I mean, it might be simpler than the same I've never used zoom We've used a different type of media thing to use, but weren't operating now the guy who runs our mention he was operating it sometimes successfully, sometimes not. It is technical technology challenge if you like, love it laughs. The colleague I'm talking about. Well, it's. That sort of thing, if somebody said to me, Oh, you need to get on to this, you need to get on to that. That scares me. Like you say, it does scare you technology, am I going to be using computers for about 22 years and I'm still just scratching the surface. I can do e-mails."
108,177,177,Speaker 2,M,01:13:13,"I don't know what it is. I think it's a fear of the unknown. And you read about all the scams. But I mean, I can do the basics. I can send the emails attachments, I can open the emails. So to me, I can do what's important to me. Um."
109,179,179,Speaker 2,M,01:13:40,"It does for me. You know, like I say, I use my phone to do it. I've got a laptop not used for about three years. I've got a tablet. I get a struggle on that when trying to get onto the home page I need. I used to ask a friend to bring them up, saying I'm struggling come around, he sort everything out for me. I don't see him now. and the other friend that did it. And unfortunately, she passed away. So I feel like I'm on my own now and I feel really at a loss because where I live, I'm probably one of the youngest. You know, so there are some who use the internet, but mainly for shopping or ordering food online. And that's it. No, I don't do that. You know, I'm old fashioned, so I just like to, uh. I'm happy with what I can do But there were a couple of time later on when I make stuck in the house and I need to do more on the computers and things like that, and I just don't absorb it there. I do have a problem with dyslexia, but I know what the government member is."
110,180,180,Speaker 2,M,01:14:57,"To me at the moment is helpful, but there are people that have made that go insane. It's all. And I think people do struggle with it."
111,181,181,Speaker 1,M,01:15:08,I struggle with that. Yeah.
112,183,183,Speaker 4,M,01:16:20,"Maybe some people are scared by technology, including me. Some people are not like Hazel or she doesn't know about technology."
113,184,184,Speaker 2,M,01:16:31,Not as good as critics.
114,185,185,Speaker 4,M,01:16:33,"For example, I think it will become to some extent now. We don't see on the news all the hundreds and hundreds of people who are losing their life savings through internet banking. And they are."
115,186,186,Speaker 2,M,01:16:46,"Yes, I saw on the news with the eBay alone in the southwest, £25million stolen through scammers that we see in the southwest. You know, I've been ripped off. Nothing massive. The first one was about twenty five pound instead of six ninety nine. So I'm very dubious of what I go on to buy anything. And so it's very rare buying if you online, I go radiates cover for one of the residents. I'm supposed to be near to the. He didn't want to do it. He wanted me to do it. Yes, it looked the same. I was getting to the point where I was looking at the scene and I thought, I don't recognise that company name and don't recognise that company name. So I rang up my sister she said tribe from world. Don't do radiates covers, what they do, and you get special offers, so I ordered in that we've got it. So the next one he wants we'll order through the same company because we know it's genuine. Yeah."
116,188,188,Speaker 2,M,01:18:02,"No. You know, if it sounds too good to be true, then it is."
117,189,189,Speaker 2,M,01:18:30,Stairs without banisters for me. So especially without was a bit of banisters to.
118,190,190,Speaker 4,M,01:18:39,"Well, I wouldn't be without my handrails up the stairs now, and I didn't ask for. Oh, I've no reason to rub it down, but about four bypasses I've lost all my energy to having had colon cancer twice an insulin dependent diabetic. All sorts of things. And when I was last in hospital, they certainly organised at all these rails and I couldn't do without them now. But you know, I manage if but they were then and."
119,191,191,Speaker 2,M,01:19:09,"I couldn't even let me stay and I can't. I've got two options, you know,."
120,193,193,Speaker 4,M,01:19:47,"and whatever people might say about PCH. I mean, saying this year, but I found the wonderful, Oh yeah, yeah, I'm the beast and I own the property. I don't own the sort of walls and things, but that where I had a problem, they've done marvellous. The job and charge me quarter is because they have taken the bathroom and it was coming from the maisonette above mine and they spent four days with plumbers and carpenters."
121,194,194,Speaker 2,M,01:20:15,"You yeah, you don't got a landlord. I mean, it is it. I was in associations, you know, as great as I'm going to put it words, which is helpful if you like as PCH. Yeah. And I know what they like. I work for it and now give me landlords, you know, and go with being grateful to like Hazel. Yeah, organising quizzes and things like that. Our place. Um, I mean, I know that's not to do with a lot of this."
122,196,196,Speaker 2,M,01:21:29,"Yeah, I've seen that in a DIY. Big S.O.S. Big. Yes, I think we've got a lift right goes right through to where he needs it, you know? That's brilliant. So outside lifts, you've got stairs outside haven't you? and you."
123,198,198,Speaker 2,M,01:21:49,"And you can get these external ones that take you off. It's like a stair's lift, but it's external"
124,201,201,Speaker 4,M,01:22:27,"I also think it's important to appreciate what we've got. Yeah, I mean, yesterday, for example, if the gardener all day doing the gardens in the patch where I live, which is a big area with the dust bins in the middle, in a cage, and if we go up to the garden to have a cup of tea or coffee, you can do no wrong, you know?"
125,202,202,Speaker 2,M,01:22:47,"Yeah, they're not allowed to stop for tea breaks. Well, not on official tea breaks."
126,203,203,Speaker 1,M,01:22:56,Awesome. Really good.
127,204,204,Speaker 2,M,01:22:58,"Yeah. Very helpful. Even the ranges of caretakers. I know we can't I'm not allowed to come into your properties or if you need something, take it away, you can get outside your front door. The  communal , you know, and."
128,205,205,Speaker 1,M,01:23:18,And if they were to pick up steak every morning picking up the litter at nine o'clock. Wow. Yeah. Emptied the bins every couple of days.
129,206,206,Speaker 2,M,01:23:24,"Yeah, yeah. So you know, we got we do get a lot of help. It is really, you know. Well, I suppose there will come a time when I feel for it. Some people will need to move because of the environment that it may not be suitable for them now."
130,207,207,Speaker 2,M,01:23:48,"It's hard to say because we all we all have different disabilities or health. I mean, we had a lady in our class. She was totally blind. And if you're having a coffee morning or bingo after you come down, play bingo. Somebody go for one of the residents of Walton, go and bring it down and take it back up again and ..."
131,210,210,Speaker 2,M,01:25:28,Improvements?
132,215,215,Speaker 2,M,01:27:07,But it can turn to mould
133,218,218,Speaker 2,M,01:27:28,"That can affect your respiratory system, you know, breathe breathing and everything else you do."
134,221,221,Speaker 2,M,01:27:43,"Oh, yeah, so you're at you're like leaseholder."
135,223,223,Speaker 2,M,01:27:56,"Yeah, I don't know whether that's how to get things done. Yeah, there's a rent payer. I don't know, you know, but you do find that it would be hard if you to get things done."
136,224,224,Speaker 4,M,01:28:10,I've never found it difficult to get things done. I tend to put it in writing. I write a fancy letter to the little department of PCH. And I think that's better than a telephone call.
137,225,225,Speaker 2,M,01:28:21,"Oh, yes. Different landlords, again, the different levels of what they will do and what they want."
138,226,226,Speaker 4,M,01:28:29,And they've now just in the past week introduced a leasehold forum which is on Zoom. Yeah. And are you going to have a personal personal contact if you're a leaseholder to discuss any problems that might come up.
139,227,227,Speaker 2,M,01:28:56,"Yeah, of course if it's more regular. laughs"
140,229,229,Speaker 2,M,01:29:03,"Yeah. The thing I I don't use buses now, but I've heard a lot of complaints from some of the residents. The post that goes from town to 25, I think, is a one to the Barbican and the Hoe."
141,230,230,Speaker 4,M,01:29:15,You have to be fine.
142,231,231,Speaker 2,M,01:29:17,"And they went to use the normal single decker bus. In the summer they're using in the tourist bus. And then when the tourist bus comes and it's full up. Yeah, the regular people who live around there want to get to the doctors at West Hoe, can't get on the bus. Mm-Hmm. Mm hmm. And because of that, you know, enough, I think, is stupid. You don't need that. You can have the tourist bus on, but keep the 25 the normal service going instead of swapping it. You know,"
143,233,233,Speaker 2,M,01:29:50,"No, there isn't no there. So you get a lot less seats."
144,235,235,Speaker 2,M,01:30:02,"So that, you know, that's here. I mean, I don't know about the rest, about the town and other areas. You know, I know you get some areas where the bus is every half an hour, and it can be every hour"
145,236,236,Speaker 4,M,01:30:15,"You get unlucky, within five metres of my front door there's a bus every 10 minutes. The 51 or the 21."
146,238,238,Speaker 2,M,01:30:38,It  is just too many red? Yeah. laughs
147,244,244,Speaker 1,M,01:33:00,That's right.
148,247,247,Speaker 2,M,01:34:14,"we have that problem on our face. So when you get a group of people sat down just talking amongst themselves. And then somebody's phone rings. And she talked about the fact that I can't hear you, there is too much noise. People I feel like say, Well, don't stay here on your phone. Go somewhere where it's quiet. They don't. You know you're right about these hearing aids. I've heard about, you know what? I don't need them. I just don't listen"
149,249,249,Speaker 2,M,01:35:03,"Well, but is it an invisible disability? People don't notice."
150,251,251,Speaker 2,M,01:35:16,"Something I suppose I've learnt living where I live with people. We've been hearing aids and someone say, Can you speak up or or can you seat on this side to make? Because that's be good. It has to be bad, you know,."
151,255,255,Speaker 2,M,01:38:28,Some people think of ISO because  I've hearing loop in the communal room.
152,258,258,Speaker 2,M,01:39:35,"Yeah. I would worry about catching me. I've got new leg, which we only got yesterday. I worried about catching that on these walking behind me. Careful, careful. You know, like you say, if you're in a wheelchair..."
153,261,261,Speaker 4,M,01:41:25,"but what I find very helpful with cooking, particularly in the sense that, you know,."
154,262,262,Speaker 2,M,01:41:38,"One in the hallway and one in the bathroom we've got Pendants Show. We've got we've got also got wristbands, which you can use. Um, I was given a wristband. Yeah. So many run my flat number. It comes through the intercom I can answer it without getting off the chair. press it once to speak to the person you know you. Plus a second time when the doors open, which I thought it was fantastic. I'd never seen that before."
155,264,264,Speaker 2,M,01:42:43,"Some people have to pay for that out their own pocket, don't they?"
156,266,266,Speaker 2,M,01:42:49,I don't know. I don't know. I know in Marlborough how some people in the flat say
157,267,267,Speaker 4,M,01:42:56,"Mm. Yeah. But I found very useful that cooking is my oven packed up and I bought a new one. I bought a Hotpoint It cost me a hundred quid on the internet that was all. And it had this facility, which I find invaluable, and that is when I put something under the grill, I then put the timer on. Yeah, but it switched itself off. So so now where I've previously I forgot about it and it just had burnt bacon. it's not done perfectly because I know exactly how many minutes it was it switched iself off, so often they try to get carried away watching something for example."
158,269,269,Speaker 2,M,01:43:46,"We've got our alarms going off. Oh yeah, because somebody fell asleep on the sofa and that's something on the hob, wherever, you know. And it's a brilliant idea. Yeah. I mean, if I'm doing chips in a chip pan, I don't like these fryers. It's the horrible thing. I like your standard chip pan. I stand by that cooker from start to finish, then you get often. But I'm fortunate I can do that, you know, again. So it's hard for me to say what barriers may come in front of me that 20 years."
159,271,271,Speaker 2,M,01:44:46,I might be able to draw a line at low
160,273,273,Speaker 2,M,01:44:51,"I haven't got the manual for it and that was given to me. If you're two years old and it was given to me, and so I would give it to you from the air fryer to a proper conventional cooker, which I've always liked. So I don't know whether it was this guy. I know it's got a timer on running for the oven, whether it's for anything else on that, I don't know. I can probably download the manual for it. Oh, I thought you was saying that."
161,275,275,Speaker 2,M,01:48:38,"Can I think something? It's not my it's been a relative inclusion actually. Having come to me, ask me, I have no idea that, you know, when you're saying you need to say your GP service? Yeah, go username, password. Yeah. And sometime in which is going come into a password not recognised and it and then you should turn out. Her son checked her computer it wasn't her computer, it was a GP sensor, it was. There is a code and she couldn't get through to a doctor and she needed medication urgently nebuliser, you know, um, I've never used mine since it went online. I've never used it. Not that I don't want to. I don't even know what the website address is, so I have to ring them open. Ask them where you can get through. Um, that's the problem. You know, technical stuff, folks, and stuff like that. If the system's going down. Yeah. To Ringo, oh, you'd have to try again tomorrow. Love to try again tomorrow. An actual person, you could be dead by tomorrow. You know, I mean, not everybody knows it when you're feeling unwell, it's life threatening. Yeah. And you're ringing the GP because you don't want to bother your neighbours."
162,276,276,Speaker 4,M,01:50:04,"The other thing is, the older we get, I think safety is very, very important, you know? Yeah, I when I moved into my place, I bought myself from the re-use centre in Union Street, a tumble dryer. I paid ten quid for it. Yeah. And I got it home and it worked. I look on the internet and it was suspect to fire. Yeah. So I ran the Whirlpool and I said, Look, I've got a tumble dryer of yours and you say it's one of the other risks. So they said that's all right give me the serial number, and within two weeks they did bring me a new one."
163,277,277,Speaker 2,M,01:50:38,"Oh, that's fair enough! laughs"
164,280,280,Speaker 2,M,01:50:50,"That's right. Are a lot of time. You've got to go on the internet to find the phone number so. Yeah, it does happen. Yeah, I got news. I bought a scooter that can run from better life. Yeah. Lloyd's chemist used to sell,"
165,336,54,Speaker 7,M,00:18:25,"Get to the airport, put my case in, next stop. You know, the bark."
166,338,56,Speaker 7,M,00:19:16,"Gardening, yes."
167,340,58,Speaker 7,M,00:19:31,"She was fine. she was all right. I mean, the first plant landed upside down"
168,351,69,Speaker 7,M,00:22:38,"Well, sometimes you get, you know, a bit negative. Yeah, I like to say something serene. You know? Yeah, like I said, that is it. Right? Well, yeah. You know that all these, you know?"
169,354,72,Speaker 7,M,00:23:00,"Yeah, just get him off the chair and just sit outside in the fresh air saying, try it now, but I've tried to say, man instead of me doing it today, you do it. You know? But he's afraid of falling over. The guy fell over several times and of course.."
170,356,74,Speaker 7,M,00:23:29,Got in touch with the right people? Yes. To one another. Yeah.
171,359,77,Speaker 7,M,00:24:00,"He's been so independent because, I mean, he was he was in the Marines, but he's been so independent and helping other people before he needed himself and he doesn't like it."
172,369,87,Speaker 7,M,00:43:30,It works both for and.
173,371,89,Speaker 7,M,00:43:46,We never know. Laughs.
174,377,95,Speaker 7,M,00:45:03,"And this is often very, very commonly when we call our GP. It's so difficult to talk to your GP, I mean, you just end up in these terrible menus."
175,407,125,Speaker 7,M,00:55:11,"The only danger I can see is crime. Crime is a lot, isn't it?"
176,432,150,Speaker 7,M,01:04:58,They don't have taxis today from community aims to begin
177,434,152,Speaker 7,M,01:05:03,"No, that wasn't the taxi, that that was a human error."
178,451,169,Speaker 8,M,01:10:49,That's a difficult one.
179,455,173,Speaker 8,M,01:11:24,"Technology, stairs and trip hazards"
180,485,203,Speaker 7,M,01:24:32,You've got some undesirable people in our block.
181,506,224,Speaker 8,M,01:32:16,"The deliveries, delivery services, as a negative, because they don't bring it all the way up the stairs."
182,516,4,Speaker 5,M,00:03:58,I live with a partner on one cat.
183,519,7,Speaker 5,M,00:05:11,"Yeah. I don't think I'd mind because if I feel that I need help with somebody around in case something happens to be, I feel bad for somebody with. You know, if that was something someone was knocking every day or checking, if I'm OK."
184,521,9,Speaker 5,M,00:05:30,Are they?
185,528,16,Speaker 5,M,00:07:01,I'm shaving less often.
186,534,22,Speaker 5,M,00:08:41,Tapioca!
187,543,31,Speaker 5,M,00:11:19,"I like gardening, so I'd like green space to look after when I'm older. Feed the birds and stuff like that."
188,548,36,Speaker 5,M,00:12:45,"Walking, I like countryside walking."
189,552,40,Speaker 5,M,00:12:57,It's not that flat in Plymouth by the way.
190,566,54,Speaker 5,M,00:16:27,I guess it's the mental distress that it causes. Isn't it ? when you can't do what you were used to  maybe ??? with life? Yeah. You know.
191,590,78,Speaker 5,M,00:20:40,"And I think it'd be quite nice. I mean, people do things for you."
192,591,79,Speaker 5,M,00:20:45,"yeah, I won't mind."
193,593,81,Speaker 5,M,00:20:52,I just give them more jobs.
194,615,103,Speaker 5,M,00:25:11,"Yeah, I've seen it right. I enjoy a good book or good films. I just noticed reading that I really enjoy a good book or watching a good film."
195,619,107,Speaker 5,M,00:26:44,"Yeah, I'll make rude comment"
196,622,110,Speaker 5,M,00:27:27,"Yes, yes. You know, regarding the car accident, you had to."
197,624,112,Speaker 5,M,00:27:54,A few of us mentioned walking.
198,629,117,Speaker 5,M,00:28:38,"Cooking is fun, isn't it? because you can look forward to eating after that."
199,634,122,Speaker 5,M,00:29:27,"I think I have it for granted in a way, but it's taken away. Yeah. See if you are alone for the week."
200,656,144,Speaker 5,M,00:34:26,"Well, isolation was used in prisons as a punishment, wasn't it?"
201,657,145,Speaker 5,M,00:34:33,Oh yeah. So you'd be locked on your own.
202,659,147,Speaker 5,M,00:34:45,"And I think there was a study made by a bit of a cruel statistically, but I think they did it with cats and the cats would be happier if you had any kind of contact, even if it was negative contact if it was just hit. Kind of thing, rather than stroke, it would be happier just because of the contact. So they were saying, well, that could be sort of people as well. Yeah. So just bad, any contact was better than nothing at all which is weird."
203,660,148,Speaker 5,M,00:35:34,Very important! Laughs..
204,665,153,Speaker 5,M,00:36:28,"Well, that's where you got all the guts??? Said, which is great things you wouldn't say in the office."
205,667,155,Speaker 5,M,00:36:46,"And you get to learn about all the teams because suddenly we're going to talk of the other teams in the organisation unless there's a meeting or something or something formal. So, yeah, so you get to know what's happening in their little neck of the woods."
206,672,160,Speaker 5,M,00:50:38,"Yeah, yeah. There's a can opener??? Which is really good. Yeah."
207,677,165,Speaker 5,M,00:51:28,You could put the light somewhere else?
208,683,171,Speaker 5,M,00:52:49,A lack of money could be a barrier.
209,685,173,Speaker 5,M,00:53:23,"You've got to qualify, I think. Yeah. And then social services would help you."
210,694,182,Speaker 5,M,00:54:22,"And it's knowing that that help is out there as well, because you may not know that you could get help. Yeah. So it'd be nice if somebody came to see you and explained, Oh yeah, you could have this, you could have that because I'm sure a lot of think lots of older people don't claim certain things today and that they're entitled to."
211,699,187,Speaker 5,M,00:55:18,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, she's paid all her life social insurance. That's what it's for, isn't it?"
212,710,198,Speaker 5,M,00:59:08,Especially with clothes because you want to feel them and try them on.
213,718,206,Speaker 5,M,01:00:03,Look for the bargains.
214,723,211,Speaker 5,M,01:00:48,They don't always give you the very thing either.
215,725,213,Speaker 5,M,01:00:55,"It's the same colour..Laughs.  Yeah, yeah."
216,736,224,Speaker 5,M,01:02:57,"Yes. Knowledge. Would it be big for me? Knowledge knowing? Yeah, yeah. Information?"
217,737,225,Speaker 5,M,01:03:04,Yeah. So it's something you haven't heard about
218,743,231,Speaker 5,M,01:04:07,something like 65.
219,753,241,Speaker 5,M,01:05:22,Transport.
220,757,245,Speaker 5,M,01:05:38,"Oh, I see."
221,762,250,Speaker 6,M,01:06:08,"Maybe the mobility? Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. Like, moving yourself and also transporting things. So it's more like for mobility. Yeah. Yeah."
222,764,252,Speaker 6,M,01:06:27,"Yeah, something like this. I loved the whole knowledge that you guys talked about because this is something that's not exactly physical. It doesn't fit anywhere, but it's just amazing. And I think that that's something we need to think about."
223,768,256,Speaker 6,M,01:07:10,An information centre.
224,770,258,Speaker 5,M,01:07:26,"Because it's always something you learn like, Oh, I didn't know. But even now in my job and I should know what's out there, mostly. But that's always something I think I've got to know about that."
225,790,278,Speaker 5,M,01:10:51,"They are company, aren't they?"
226,793,281,Speaker 5,M,01:11:32,something to worry about.
227,795,283,Speaker 5,M,01:11:53,When did she die?
228,797,285,Speaker 5,M,01:11:57,Oh yeah. Are you going to get another one?
229,799,287,Speaker 5,M,01:12:05,Just take on home.
230,811,299,Speaker 5,M,01:13:56,"Yeah, it comes with adaptations."
231,812,300,Speaker 6,M,01:13:59,"It's a very broad categories, so..."
232,820,308,Speaker 5,M,01:15:16,"no. It's nice down there, isn't it?"
233,824,312,Speaker 6,M,01:17:14,Is it a shared table  or something like that? I don't know.
234,834,322,Speaker 5,M,01:20:20,"I was going to say often it's we compared to China you know, where the culture is different, where the elderly are more respected. I mean, we don't live in the same house. Yeah, there is more social connections. Well, in Britain, we've lost a lot of that in the last century, I think."
235,843,331,Speaker 5,M,01:22:35,"It's kind of interesting stuff, you know, you just got to try  once you're older, you know, like, you know, well, maybe somebody younger. Yeah. So maybe not so valued."
236,847,335,Speaker 5,M,01:23:42,You need to put your foot down.
237,854,342,Speaker 5,M,01:24:36,"Because it's a big social thing with Facebook and stuff now. Yeah, yeah."
238,875,363,Speaker 5,M,01:29:48,"Unless she missed it, you know, because you are told so many things anyway and you can't remember everything."
239,884,372,Speaker 5,M,01:30:38,"I'm thinking about social groups as well as clubs, and there is like something holding people back like all that's not for me. Oh, that's not my kind of thing. Well, in fact, if you were to go along with it, make new friends and probably have a laugh. Yeah, and it would be generally, good, good for them. So I think people should be encouraged to do more."
240,888,376,Speaker 5,M,01:31:36,"It is creating the family, I suppose, isn't it?"
241,896,384,Speaker 5,M,01:33:12,Like the TV is a big social friend for people as well.
242,899,387,Speaker 5,M,01:33:27,"Whatever people can access, I guess. Yeah, but it's like a friend in the corner, isn't it? yeah. Keep it coming."
243,902,390,Speaker 5,M,01:33:46,What was that Gogglebox?
244,904,392,Speaker 5,M,01:33:49,"When I watch someone, I feel as if I'm there with them, in the chats as it were, so it's like, Oh, they're my friends. So it's kind of like a social contact in a way. Yeah, it's weird."
245,918,406,Speaker 5,M,01:35:30,I prefer face to face.
246,922,410,Speaker 5,M,01:35:43,"Hmm. I don't know, the interaction isn't as fluid. Yeah, no."
247,924,412,Speaker 5,M,01:35:56,I don't mind it.
248,926,414,Speaker 5,M,01:36:25,"Well, I got some Facebook. I've never would have otherwise."
249,928,416,Speaker 5,M,01:36:29,"Because I'm a bit phobic of technology,"
250,930,418,Speaker 5,M,01:36:49,What's the topic?
251,932,420,Speaker 5,M,01:36:57,Have you got a bar?
252,947,435,Speaker 5,M,01:40:39,"Family is a support, yeah"
253,952,440,Speaker 5,M,01:40:55,Social Connections.
254,953,441,Speaker 5,M,01:41:07,"Yeah, OK. I think technology, TV and social media are the big one."
255,954,442,Speaker 5,M,01:41:17,because we I think people watch tons of TV.
256,960,448,Speaker 5,M,01:42:56,"What about mental health in terms of if you're going physically going worse, you feel bad in your head. Yes. And then you don't feel like going out to meeting people."
257,962,450,Speaker 5,M,01:43:15,When we can't be bothered to go to the church. You know what you're feeling?
258,965,453,Speaker 5,M,01:43:26,Drugs.
