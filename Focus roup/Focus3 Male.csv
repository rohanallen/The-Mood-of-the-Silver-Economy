0,4,Speaker 5,M,00:03:58,I live with a partner on one cat.
1,7,Speaker 5,M,00:05:11,"Yeah. I don't think I'd mind because if I feel that I need help with somebody around in case something happens to be, I feel bad for somebody with. You know, if that was something someone was knocking every day or checking, if I'm OK."
2,9,Speaker 5,M,00:05:30,Are they?
3,16,Speaker 5,M,00:07:01,I'm shaving less often.
4,22,Speaker 5,M,00:08:41,Tapioca!
5,31,Speaker 5,M,00:11:19,"I like gardening, so I'd like green space to look after when I'm older. Feed the birds and stuff like that."
6,36,Speaker 5,M,00:12:45,"Walking, I like countryside walking."
7,40,Speaker 5,M,00:12:57,It's not that flat in Plymouth by the way.
8,54,Speaker 5,M,00:16:27,I guess it's the mental distress that it causes. Isn't it ? when you can't do what you were used to  maybe ??? with life? Yeah. You know.
9,78,Speaker 5,M,00:20:40,"And I think it'd be quite nice. I mean, people do things for you."
10,79,Speaker 5,M,00:20:45,"yeah, I won't mind."
11,81,Speaker 5,M,00:20:52,I just give them more jobs.
12,103,Speaker 5,M,00:25:11,"Yeah, I've seen it right. I enjoy a good book or good films. I just noticed reading that I really enjoy a good book or watching a good film."
13,107,Speaker 5,M,00:26:44,"Yeah, I'll make rude comment"
14,110,Speaker 5,M,00:27:27,"Yes, yes. You know, regarding the car accident, you had to."
15,112,Speaker 5,M,00:27:54,A few of us mentioned walking.
16,117,Speaker 5,M,00:28:38,"Cooking is fun, isn't it? because you can look forward to eating after that."
17,122,Speaker 5,M,00:29:27,"I think I have it for granted in a way, but it's taken away. Yeah. See if you are alone for the week."
18,144,Speaker 5,M,00:34:26,"Well, isolation was used in prisons as a punishment, wasn't it?"
19,145,Speaker 5,M,00:34:33,Oh yeah. So you'd be locked on your own.
20,147,Speaker 5,M,00:34:45,"And I think there was a study made by a bit of a cruel statistically, but I think they did it with cats and the cats would be happier if you had any kind of contact, even if it was negative contact if it was just hit. Kind of thing, rather than stroke, it would be happier just because of the contact. So they were saying, well, that could be sort of people as well. Yeah. So just bad, any contact was better than nothing at all which is weird."
21,148,Speaker 5,M,00:35:34,Very important! Laughs..
22,153,Speaker 5,M,00:36:28,"Well, that's where you got all the guts??? Said, which is great things you wouldn't say in the office."
23,155,Speaker 5,M,00:36:46,"And you get to learn about all the teams because suddenly we're going to talk of the other teams in the organisation unless there's a meeting or something or something formal. So, yeah, so you get to know what's happening in their little neck of the woods."
24,160,Speaker 5,M,00:50:38,"Yeah, yeah. There's a can opener??? Which is really good. Yeah."
25,165,Speaker 5,M,00:51:28,You could put the light somewhere else?
26,171,Speaker 5,M,00:52:49,A lack of money could be a barrier.
27,173,Speaker 5,M,00:53:23,"You've got to qualify, I think. Yeah. And then social services would help you."
28,182,Speaker 5,M,00:54:22,"And it's knowing that that help is out there as well, because you may not know that you could get help. Yeah. So it'd be nice if somebody came to see you and explained, Oh yeah, you could have this, you could have that because I'm sure a lot of think lots of older people don't claim certain things today and that they're entitled to."
29,187,Speaker 5,M,00:55:18,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, she's paid all her life social insurance. That's what it's for, isn't it?"
30,198,Speaker 5,M,00:59:08,Especially with clothes because you want to feel them and try them on.
31,206,Speaker 5,M,01:00:03,Look for the bargains.
32,211,Speaker 5,M,01:00:48,They don't always give you the very thing either.
33,213,Speaker 5,M,01:00:55,"It's the same colour..Laughs.  Yeah, yeah."
34,224,Speaker 5,M,01:02:57,"Yes. Knowledge. Would it be big for me? Knowledge knowing? Yeah, yeah. Information?"
35,225,Speaker 5,M,01:03:04,Yeah. So it's something you haven't heard about
36,231,Speaker 5,M,01:04:07,something like 65.
37,241,Speaker 5,M,01:05:22,Transport.
38,245,Speaker 5,M,01:05:38,"Oh, I see."
39,250,Speaker 6,M,01:06:08,"Maybe the mobility? Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. Like, moving yourself and also transporting things. So it's more like for mobility. Yeah. Yeah."
40,252,Speaker 6,M,01:06:27,"Yeah, something like this. I loved the whole knowledge that you guys talked about because this is something that's not exactly physical. It doesn't fit anywhere, but it's just amazing. And I think that that's something we need to think about."
41,256,Speaker 6,M,01:07:10,An information centre.
42,258,Speaker 5,M,01:07:26,"Because it's always something you learn like, Oh, I didn't know. But even now in my job and I should know what's out there, mostly. But that's always something I think I've got to know about that."
43,278,Speaker 5,M,01:10:51,"They are company, aren't they?"
44,281,Speaker 5,M,01:11:32,something to worry about.
45,283,Speaker 5,M,01:11:53,When did she die?
46,285,Speaker 5,M,01:11:57,Oh yeah. Are you going to get another one?
47,287,Speaker 5,M,01:12:05,Just take on home.
48,299,Speaker 5,M,01:13:56,"Yeah, it comes with adaptations."
49,300,Speaker 6,M,01:13:59,"It's a very broad categories, so..."
50,308,Speaker 5,M,01:15:16,"no. It's nice down there, isn't it?"
51,312,Speaker 6,M,01:17:14,Is it a shared table  or something like that? I don't know.
52,322,Speaker 5,M,01:20:20,"I was going to say often it's we compared to China you know, where the culture is different, where the elderly are more respected. I mean, we don't live in the same house. Yeah, there is more social connections. Well, in Britain, we've lost a lot of that in the last century, I think."
53,331,Speaker 5,M,01:22:35,"It's kind of interesting stuff, you know, you just got to try  once you're older, you know, like, you know, well, maybe somebody younger. Yeah. So maybe not so valued."
54,335,Speaker 5,M,01:23:42,You need to put your foot down.
55,342,Speaker 5,M,01:24:36,"Because it's a big social thing with Facebook and stuff now. Yeah, yeah."
56,363,Speaker 5,M,01:29:48,"Unless she missed it, you know, because you are told so many things anyway and you can't remember everything."
57,372,Speaker 5,M,01:30:38,"I'm thinking about social groups as well as clubs, and there is like something holding people back like all that's not for me. Oh, that's not my kind of thing. Well, in fact, if you were to go along with it, make new friends and probably have a laugh. Yeah, and it would be generally, good, good for them. So I think people should be encouraged to do more."
58,376,Speaker 5,M,01:31:36,"It is creating the family, I suppose, isn't it?"
59,384,Speaker 5,M,01:33:12,Like the TV is a big social friend for people as well.
60,387,Speaker 5,M,01:33:27,"Whatever people can access, I guess. Yeah, but it's like a friend in the corner, isn't it? yeah. Keep it coming."
61,390,Speaker 5,M,01:33:46,What was that Gogglebox?
62,392,Speaker 5,M,01:33:49,"When I watch someone, I feel as if I'm there with them, in the chats as it were, so it's like, Oh, they're my friends. So it's kind of like a social contact in a way. Yeah, it's weird."
63,406,Speaker 5,M,01:35:30,I prefer face to face.
64,410,Speaker 5,M,01:35:43,"Hmm. I don't know, the interaction isn't as fluid. Yeah, no."
65,412,Speaker 5,M,01:35:56,I don't mind it.
66,414,Speaker 5,M,01:36:25,"Well, I got some Facebook. I've never would have otherwise."
67,416,Speaker 5,M,01:36:29,"Because I'm a bit phobic of technology,"
68,418,Speaker 5,M,01:36:49,What's the topic?
69,420,Speaker 5,M,01:36:57,Have you got a bar?
70,435,Speaker 5,M,01:40:39,"Family is a support, yeah"
71,440,Speaker 5,M,01:40:55,Social Connections.
72,441,Speaker 5,M,01:41:07,"Yeah, OK. I think technology, TV and social media are the big one."
73,442,Speaker 5,M,01:41:17,because we I think people watch tons of TV.
74,448,Speaker 5,M,01:42:56,"What about mental health in terms of if you're going physically going worse, you feel bad in your head. Yes. And then you don't feel like going out to meeting people."
75,450,Speaker 5,M,01:43:15,When we can't be bothered to go to the church. You know what you're feeling?
76,453,Speaker 5,M,01:43:26,Drugs.
