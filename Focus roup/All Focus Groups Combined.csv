0,0,Speaker 1,M,00:00:40,But my thoughts were to learn about technology now learning more about technology.
1,1,Speaker 2,M,00:00:50,"Um,. I'm not crazy technology, computers, even phones. I use my phone as a computer. I've got a laptop and a tablet about the use of make things right. So, um, that was it, really. And then I thought, Well, we'll learn something today."
2,2,Speaker 2,M,00:01:21,Yeah.
3,3,Speaker 1,M,00:02:04,"Very. And yeah, yeah."
4,4,Speaker 3,F,00:02:13,"Would you want to go into the, you know, bottom line, you wanted that you want to live on your place and do things in your own time?"
5,5,Speaker 2,M,00:02:31,"It's about different disabilities in one way or another. Looking at the less on the forms so that was 50 percent of where we live. People has got different disabilities. Some people we see struggle and when I became disabled I thought, well, I could get worse as I got older and yeah, I want to be able to stay at home. You know, I don't want to be living in fear of people who live after me, or not being able to do things for yourself. And I think we all feel like that, you know?"
6,6,Speaker 4,M,00:03:10,"So that's the reason I came. I love my home. Yeah, I love where I live with my home is, and I came here in the hope that I can learn to stay there as long as I can. And I'd hate to be in a residential care home, for example. It just would not be my scene."
7,7,Speaker 4,M,00:03:36,I managed to be.
8,8,Speaker 3,F,00:03:40,It drives them nuts within a week.
9,9,Speaker 3,F,00:04:02,Freedom.
10,10,Speaker 3,F,00:04:03,"Yeah, freedom."
11,11,Speaker 2,M,00:04:04,My memories of being one's own boss. Yeah.
12,12,Speaker 5,F,00:04:09,"Yeah, yeah. You guys have got memories. I mean, looking at a piece of furniture remembering. As a partner, we used to sit in that chair for example. But when you go into these homes, I don't think you're able to take very much with you at all apart from your clothes. All right. That's my understanding. I think"
13,13,Speaker 2,M,00:04:29,"it's that you thought correctly correct? You remember, Bill? Yeah, he's in a care home and he is happy enough. But he's he doesn't see anybody. How come the people in and he was running a video of where we live? He was the light of everybody's life in the, you know, he knew everything about the Barbican and everything he could tell you. He's in his 90s. He could tell you everything. And he was always pleasant to listen to. Um, when you went to a care home, you didn't see a lot of people in the building. You got a coffee mornings when you got down, you know? And so he's got more commonly where he is for each of missiles. He misses his family because they all live north and. To me, I couldn't live like that. You know, so,"
14,14,Speaker 3,F,00:08:07,"Well, this picture?"
15,15,Speaker 2,M,00:08:16,"daily activities, yes, it is"
16,16,Speaker 3,F,00:08:37,"Get in and out of bed. Well,  just living. It's not an activity, it's just existing. In fact, it's very sensitive to me at the moment because I'm fighting for some way of being able in and out of bed. And it's happening to have a sleep in the chair. And then because they can't find"
17,17,Speaker 3,F,00:09:05,It's not even mobility is just some sort of equipment and means that I don't have to have a carer coming to put me in and out of bed. so if we are getting emotional it's a bit too ...
18,18,Speaker 4,M,00:09:28,"It's little things that concern me to some extent, I mean, for example, one thing that concerns me is actually having a show of. Now, at the moment, with great difficulty, I might add, I can actually stand up in my best, but it's not easy to actually cross your leg over wow and stand up, but the council have put handrails, so you know, OK, hang on to them and I really appreciate that because without them, there's no way I could get into the best and little things like that I really appreciate. And I just wouldn't like to smell too much."
19,19,Speaker 2,M,00:10:19,"Yeah, I have a wheelchair. Yeah, which looks like the standard of the big wheel. Yeah, I have that in my shower room, so I transfer from one wheelchair to another looking out in the shower. I don't like it I would prefer to stand up. I've got bad shoulders and from trying to get the showering 100, you know, and you don't feel like you clean yourself as a proper boy but it is better than a bath. When I lost my leg, I was given one of the chairs a rise and fall from Millbrook. And that was great because then I could just raise myself up turn around the chair and put my feet down. That was from the bath. So I don't know if you've got one of them."
20,20,Speaker 4,M,00:11:08,I've got an ordinary bath
21,21,Speaker 2,M,00:11:10,ride to call when you put it in your bath.
22,22,Speaker 4,M,00:11:13,"Oh no, I got nothing in the bath except the best mate drive"
23,23,Speaker 2,M,00:11:29,"Yeah, I didn't know they existed till I got one. Yeah. And I thought. And anybody struggling to get in and out of a bath of bullying about slipping falling in the bath. I mean, say we really, for me, a period in my confidence that started off with a bench going across the bath and I nearly went headfirst into the touch. And so I was at seven. Not we're not going to forget, you know,"
24,24,Speaker 2,M,00:11:59,"that period of time where we moved when I moved to now. Most of us got wet rooms. I think there's only one fly out the 34. It's got a bath. And their ideal for us, even if you only want a walking yeah, like I say, I was given that wheel chair just sat on that and it is quite comfy cushions say, you know, it's great."
25,25,Speaker 2,M,00:12:47,Not for me?
26,26,Speaker 2,M,00:13:01,"Yeah, that that bothers me because I have neuropathy means so don't feel heat straight away. Um, when I moved back in, I'm now four years ago, I was in a wheelchair. I'm in my bedroom. Very rarely wore it. Don't do this impression, but the important hello worked for me. I didn't have open air fryer and a small hub that was great while I was in the chair that was worried about leaning forward, bending down to get to the Oven. And even now I can bend down. Sometimes I can lose me balance, so it didn't bother me. And I think as I got older, personally that does concern me. You know, I've I lost me there like that. Be it, then I wouldn't be cooking takeaways. Yeah."
27,27,Speaker 2,M,00:14:00,I like talking!
28,28,Speaker 3,F,00:14:08,"Yeah, well, not at the moment, but stairs, perhaps at some point in the future."
29,29,Speaker 3,F,00:14:17,"Yes. Well, also outside the house is two dozen stairs up from the road to the house, so maybe I'll have to move at some point."
30,30,Speaker 2,M,00:14:27,"Oh, there will be no look area,."
31,31,Speaker 4,M,00:14:40,"Transport is probably one chance for trying to get in and out because they can't use buses or taxis because I have difficulty trying to get into a door had trouble getting your car, you know? Yeah, and quite tall. Not quite as you bend, I've got back and hip problem. I can't kind of move properly. It's difficult with me. So is transport is a an issue."
32,32,Speaker 1,M,00:15:06,"I'm glad you mentioned that because transport will be the top of my list. And the reason being that as long as I can get on a bus and I can celebrate it in a bus stop, I can see my children and one lives in Launceston. One lives in Woodbridge and two and a half hours on the bus. But the only problem I've got with buses are and get on the bus at the moment and get off. But. I've got a hopefully I can manage without a wee until I get to Bodmin."
33,33,Speaker 1,M,00:15:40,pretty soon because it stops them enough above me for me to get out and have a pea that I've got to tell you this too.
34,34,Speaker 5,F,00:15:53,"Yeah, yeah, no. I'm sure I could go all the way to Bodmin to do a wee, awfull."
35,35,Speaker 2,M,00:16:19,"Yeah, I've already mentioned we're right. Yeah. You know, I've been since, you know, legally here."
36,36,Speaker 2,M,00:16:30,"It's no, definitely not. But um. I think it's a good way of being in contact with people in families. I know it's nice to be together, but with everything we've gone through, you know, on Zoom or other social media, you can be your messenger through Facebook and it is good you can see your family talking to, you know, um,"
37,37,Speaker 3,F,00:17:00,"without it through your lockdown, you wouldn't have seen anybody that didn't have no children with anybody who didn't have that. You're isolated you"
38,38,Speaker 2,M,00:17:10,"thinking, Oh yeah."
39,39,Speaker 3,F,00:17:12,"I mean, I think the said, I know it's unusual that the pandemic will take the effect on mental health as being. Of jobs,"
40,40,Speaker 2,M,00:17:24,"I struggle with it when I thought I had to isolate, because that meant taking early last year was to say isolate for 14 days. I struggled to quell my scooter to try to avoid everybody. Well, no shops open in town show free travel around there, but it can get scary as well. And I think I'm more scared now than it was last year, and I think it's because of the understanding of it about both the Jabs obsessive test yourself twice a week. But we have a great community where we live. We're lucky, we're very lucky, and we all realise that, um, we had nobody had the infection or anything like that, you know, the virus. So and we do sit downstairs. I'm not in the community when we weren't allowed to use that, but it's still sitting in the main entrance. You know, I don't"
41,41,Speaker 2,M,00:18:23,"do or out in the courtyard, you know, so we had the communication wasn't too bad for us. But if you look what your own in your own house and I think you're more isolated than I think communication right through technology is in really, you know."
42,42,Speaker 1,M,00:18:43,"When some people can't drive a car, that's how you do notoriety before then. Once you try to ?  During lockdown I was stuck for two years. Yes. We just live in a bedroom and that's it is a shared house for four people. And I wouldn't go see it."
43,43,Speaker 2,M,00:19:09,"And I just don't think even though we've got a community, we do face to face just in our reality now. You know, while they are still things like, do they really, I don't know what we would have done 40 years ago. I really don't, you know, so"
44,44,Speaker 3,F,00:20:04,"You know, I was very, very lucky at the very beginning. I had a heart bypass and my daughter took me up to Kent to stay with her. Unfortunately, not going to school. I was there, so she got stuck with me for three weeks, unfortunately. And you know, any excuse because they brought me back in time or had my first job in Kent and they brought me back to have a second one here. Uh huh.. I must be horrible. Well, it doesn't bother me. I mean, where I live, we don't have a community centre. We don't have anywhere we can go and talk. So I was in the courtroom every day, but I just didn't"
45,45,Speaker 3,F,00:20:59,"day. Yeah. Well, I'm lucky I live on the Hoe. Oh, so I've only I've only got to walk five minutes. I'm actually on the Hoe a life long live every day for a little walk and talk again. I mean, I used to see some of the neighbours, but. You know, we didn't mix."
46,46,Speaker 5,F,00:21:20,"is the ones that couldn't get out in the community. I mean, there's the bungalows and we could see if we couldn't meet up with them and it was fun to see people there was certain neighbours that we had couldn't leave home. I don't blame them. And it could be that. And I love the interaction of people. But without Zoom and teams and all that, I well, I would recommend. Definitely. I mean, I wouldn't have been able to see my family without the internet."
47,47,Speaker 3,F,00:21:53,I haven't got the internet or and I don't use the computer now just it doesn't bother me from the get go and don't bother me when I have to contact firms and they
48,48,Speaker 5,F,00:22:11,"or doctors. Doctors, now that they are nightmares now because I'm trying to get hold on to an e-consult and if you're not on the internet now, for your prescriptions and contacting doctors. That is huge!"
49,49,Speaker 5,F,00:22:27,"yeah. Well, there again, I'm very lucky because when I want my prescription, I'll just bring up a little chemist in West Hoe and they they just routinely get it and they deliver it to me."
50,50,Speaker 3,F,00:22:41,I hope they are not going to stopping that.
51,51,Speaker 5,F,00:22:43,"Yeah, I'm very lucky."
52,52,Speaker 2,M,00:22:44,"They've been very good press so of. I mean, I'm not with them, but some the our residents are yeah. And you know, I mean, that struggle. I don't even have to pay for my prescriptions. I got a text message from Boots's chemist because of pain and your prescription is ready for collection and closes the book. The booth came back only 10 minutes, you know? Yeah. So our customer, so we've been lucky like that."
53,53,Speaker 3,F,00:23:13,How did you set that up?
54,54,Speaker 2,M,00:23:16,"But I was with Lloyds in Devonport. Then when I moved, I told my doctor that my prescription is going to Boots. And at the start, I had to keep ringing up, ringing up, getting prescriptions that over now Boots supply for it, for me."
55,55,Speaker 3,F,00:23:35,My surgery will let you know what.
56,56,Speaker 2,M,00:23:38,"We won't now go back four years ago. You know, these are driving where we have all agreed for, you know what I need from when they need it. So, OK, OK."
57,57,Speaker 3,F,00:23:55,And also this kind of forgotten health care.
58,58,Speaker 2,M,00:24:00,"I forgot how my Doctor looks like,."
59,59,Speaker 3,F,00:24:03,"Well, how can they see what you look like? It's only telephone."
60,60,Speaker 5,F,00:24:08,"Yeah, that's my issue."
61,61,Speaker 2,M,00:24:09,"and you know, especially with the chest problem, and it's a bit of a telephone consultation. And when I say it's a consultation, a conversation because you will only be hearing huh huh down the phone ..."
62,62,Speaker 2,M,00:24:23,from the phone down and you prevent even breathe.
63,63,Speaker 3,F,00:24:36,"Well, I was just thinking of touch wood how fortunate I am at the moment. I did have a partner who has a lot of difficulties that you seem to have. Yeah, you make a good point. Most of your doctors, but all sort of organisations I wanted to get in touch about my television license. And there's no number to ring them. Very annoying. And yet I've done so well."
64,64,Speaker 6,F,00:25:16,"You know, I mean, I tried to ring with William, and I try to ring them the other day, and I didn't find a number, My grand daughter found it on the computer and I rang them. Oh, you've come to the wrong place, you should go for hero."
65,65,Speaker 2,M,00:25:30,"Yeah, I do get annoyed, really, don't you all?"
66,66,Speaker 6,F,00:25:33,"Yeah, yeah."
67,67,Speaker 2,M,00:25:35,"Yeah, it is very hard for trying to communicate concretely for people. And I think that's where you get fed up. And I think some people just give up to try to communicate with them. The next thing to get electricity, to know why you're doing this, why are you doing that? And again, people get put under pressure. Well, you know, it's it's horrible. Yeah, it's I'm quite fortunate I do get your scam calls, you know, text messages from my provider BT. And if I'm not sure I ring BT up, you know, saggy pants and stuff like that, you know so well, a lot of people don't know how to do all lot, you know?"
68,68,Speaker 2,M,00:26:24,"I read about after quite a lot of our residents doing jobs for them and things like that. It's something in my nature. I would reward myself and I used to work for, Yeah, and I still do it now. You know, that's what keeps me going mentally. You know, without all that I don't know, I'll be there enough income of our party, you know?"
69,69,Speaker 5,F,00:27:10,"unless there is a  danger now if you were not switched on to the scam, they'll go and say, Oh, something with your back press one. As soon as you press one."
70,70,Speaker 2,M,00:27:22,"Yeah, that's it. Yeah."
71,71,Speaker 5,F,00:27:23,"And you do it automatically like the something with the police and comics, as you know in the show. Yeah. They will panic, you know, at the moment of screen time, and I don't think so. And. But I would think you'd be lucky, he said, just don't don't don't engage conversation with people. But people do! yeah, and they get caught and they lose an awful amount of money. There's people out there, though this is awful, awful evil creatures that know it. And again, just because everything is online or on the phone. That's how you get people's lives in danger for all this technology"
72,72,Speaker 2,M,00:28:07,"to do something very plausible, the people very and I sometimes tell our residents like I've had this scam call, if you get a scam call or they're asking you to BT again, we say my payment last month hasn't gone through and they take my details. Well, I've checked my bank statement. I know that it was paid, so I didn't have to do anything else. I just blocked the numbers. But they come back with different numbers"
73,73,Speaker 2,M,00:28:37,oh they did
74,74,Speaker 2,M,00:28:38,"So it's it's never ended, and I don't think it will stop the way we're going to stop it."
75,75,Speaker 4,M,00:28:48,There is a way for these big companies don't want to.
76,76,Speaker 2,M,00:29:10,"You can't keep. Yes. Yeah. We have agreed to our place doing Taichi every Monday afternoon. I start doing it with them well, so a lot of them, our regulars, that they drifted off along with what your you can't be with the big group and this group called the Barbican legends, which there were a lot around the Barbican. They were coming in, doing this Taichi. It is very good for you."
77,77,Speaker 2,M,00:29:41,"And it's a great way of being able to meet up with people. But at the moment it is not right to do. Um, I think they started it again and"
78,78,Speaker 2,M,00:30:01,"Yeah, for now we can't."
79,79,Speaker 2,M,00:30:09,"That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah."
80,80,Speaker 4,M,00:30:12,"So if I can just just go back three spaces. Somebody mentioned television licences. Now there's no getting away from the fact that television is very important to elderly people who are confined to their own home. Yeah, now I'm 82 soon be 83, and I've got a TV licence because they stop the free ones. And this week, for example, I got a message to renew my television licence, and I haven't done so because I got so annoyed that the millions and millions of people have not even done last year's licence. And yet, so I think because it's so important that elderly people have the facility legally to watch television, it ought to be sorted out."
81,81,Speaker 2,M,00:30:57,"Yeah, I get mine to be renewed every year automatically, and I don't know why, because by the people I to."
82,82,Speaker 4,M,00:31:06,"I don't mind paying, but I do expect other people to expect other people to pay."
83,83,Speaker 6,F,00:31:11,"A little bit of back, some decent television."
84,84,Speaker 2,M,00:31:17,"The repeat programmes, you could expect a double bill for your licence."
85,85,Speaker 4,M,00:32:28,"Well, we'll just make one comment on digital communication. I didn't actually comment when it was discussed. I use a zoom, a great deal and sometimes that as many as 400 people can go on Zoom sessions from around the world little corners of the world had never heard of."
86,86,Speaker 4,M,00:32:50,How do I use it?
87,87,Speaker 4,M,00:32:57,"I use it for groups of which I am myself a member and the worldwide groups, and I use it for church activities, which I am a member. And I also use it digitally for communicating with my children with a portal, which is a magic machine. I just make telephone calls by saying to the television, Please ring Harry and Harry's on the television."
88,88,Speaker 2,M,00:33:28,"I also wondered about that one. Well, I'd probably get it for my family. Well."
89,89,Speaker 4,M,00:33:32,"So having said that, I'm not keen on it if I think about it deeply because it really does eliminate social interaction. Person to person, yes. So although I'm spot on a bit of a coward in a way, I use it. But. The back of my head says I don't really agree with this."
90,90,Speaker 3,F,00:34:04,So it is both
91,91,Speaker 2,M,00:34:07,I would say the pope was there on a big TV screen. You can see the state that was behind the screen and completely look like you got real bad luck.
92,92,Speaker 4,M,00:34:19,I only got this because one of my kids bought it for Christmas.
93,93,Speaker 2,M,00:34:22,Yeah.
94,94,Speaker 2,M,00:34:24,"No, I think I said digital interaction. Um, communication is important, but there are still a lot of people that don't have that. They don't want to. You know, I'm. I got it for just over two years, and I'm still scratching the surface with it, um. People come to me and ask me. Because so wrong when we computed hello. No, but your son can work for the education services on I.T., you know? So, um, I'm more a practical person."
95,95,Speaker 6,F,00:35:41,"Well, the way I've been thinking. I'm sorry and everything things down because I'm so used to doing it. It seems to be self-care, social interaction, and I guess it's not so magical. So it's self-care. And that breaks up into all sorts of activities, social interaction and medical and financial. Accessing those."
96,96,Speaker 5,F,00:36:11,You're good.
97,97,Speaker 2,M,00:36:29,"Do you think that a lot of people think a realise that you know about self-care, that is important"
98,98,Speaker 6,F,00:36:35,"exactly what is it? See, I use 40 words but two would do. Yeah, yeah."
99,99,Speaker 3,F,00:36:41,All the different activities tells us that it's totally those
100,100,Speaker 2,M,00:36:44,"same as activities, you know, even though it's essential to you. You know, I've got to have a bath. It's an activity or a shower. You know, it's an activity."
101,101,Speaker 5,F,00:36:57,"But this session don't, isn't it?"
102,102,Speaker 2,M,00:37:01,"People say to me, Always enjoy what you do or enjoy doing what you do. I have got saving for life, and I'm fortunate to have that. Um? Well, so, I've seen people that hasn't, you know, people"
103,103,Speaker 3,F,00:37:19,"with it, isn't it? Two things of the three important things is some of the things you want to do, but there's some things you have to do of those, those three, all the activities you have to do. You have to look after yourself. What was the middle name again?"
104,104,Speaker 3,F,00:37:35,"So social, interactive. Yeah, your health and well-being is included in your social and stuff."
105,105,Speaker 6,F,00:37:47,"Because there was no idea. OK. She's not confused. I'm lucky because all I do is to jump on the bus and go into town do some shopping there is this. I was used to thinking of reserves with that stuff. Yeah, yeah. Tuesdays I used to go for lunch at the church in Glenfield. That's yeah. Well, now I make myself go into water for a walk on the road or catch the bus in the town."
106,106,Speaker 5,F,00:38:17,"and it's important. Yeah, if you talk about what's in the three top important things it's important to and yeah, I think I just think you're good."
107,107,Speaker 4,M,00:38:30,"But I think the transport as a part of social interaction is vital. I mean, for example, I've got a son who's a copper in Launceston. Yeah. Now I'm going to hop on the bus right outside my door. No one from here to those tables that hop on the bus and I get off at Tesco's in Launceston, which is eight minutes for my son, he collects me in the car. Yeah, I'm just starting to get some of the best of Tesco's naturally, but"
108,108,Speaker 2,M,00:38:59,"then I'm fortunate I've got a car hold beloved for. I don't know what I do generally road some of the residents around to the garden centres that help yourself, you know, so I've got no taxis but waste money on taxis, you know that. So I enjoy getting out excuse to get out. And so that is important to me."
109,109,Speaker 5,F,00:39:23,"Um, with transport going on that, yeah, I'm limited."
110,110,Speaker 2,M,00:39:27,"Yes, you are."
111,111,Speaker 5,F,00:39:28,"Yeah, yeah. But I mean, I'm pretty nifty getting on and off both the load, the ramp and stuff. Yeah, crashed of the south on the bus that we gloss over that. But it would be here if it's not on the bus route. There's only a certain type of taxi. I can have a map, but you probably yeah, it comes back to transport. It is huge."
112,112,Speaker 2,M,00:39:50,"Yeah, yeah. Is there any approximation when you crashed on the bus I worked with was comedy, a nightclub, three buses in the depot."
113,113,Speaker 2,M,00:39:58,"So I burst in because the crowds in the way that I went because it felt I felt pressured to do that and put the post goes quiet because I do like to use to drive. I do reverse parking and they'll go, Oh, you know, the flashing to the side? Yeah, something out."
114,114,Speaker 1,M,00:40:19,"I don't know his picture post. You can't, you"
115,115,Speaker 1,M,00:40:24,"know, it's a self-drive 'cause people make up, they go off, right? And I had two arguments to have taxi drivers in Plymouth but I didn't hear. He started giving me a lot of, you know, doing that and I'll get off an engineering and technology made.You would think a lot about Typekit. I think more people are going to get hit by a car, but yeah,."
116,116,Speaker 2,M,00:40:48,"They are know what you're saying, but it's all about climate change and people have to suffer with climate change and not just because of climate change. Electric cars, like you said, they're very quiet. I've never stepped out looking the wrong way, but you know, you don't ever call me, you know, so there's no"
117,117,Speaker 6,F,00:41:08,"way they can let you know I'll meet someone who's I've been down to the Did you come from home? Yeah, I'm going"
118,118,Speaker 6,F,00:41:17,"to say this about the guide dogs. All that because the guide dogs go by what they can hear. Yeah, yeah. So it's really massive. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
119,119,Speaker 3,F,00:42:11,It's not been introduced.
120,120,Speaker 5,F,00:42:14,"No, I know"
121,121,Speaker 3,F,00:42:15,what it's
122,122,Speaker 3,F,00:42:16,"like coming otherwise three three years in this place. But in the Pines University here, 50 years ago, it's never, never"
123,123,Speaker 3,F,00:42:26,"been a polytechnic. Yes. Yeah, I think so. She's very down. That's all you need to know. Oh, yeah, yeah."
124,124,Speaker 4,M,00:42:44,"But it was a complete idiot or not. One thing I miss is my driving licence and I can't drive. And I just let it lapse, like living in France and Belgium, and I didn't need one because this is I just never one of  ..."
125,125,Speaker 4,M,00:45:26,"Yeah, we're getting my driving licence back. It is not impossible that they have a point because I'm insulin dependent diabetic and had four heart bypass. I have cancer twice. They take all these medical things into account. And because you're over 80 years , You wait for years to get your driving licence, which is really going to make it hard to just renewed your degree and wouldn't have any problems in this country."
126,126,Speaker 4,M,00:53:19,"When you think of how the world's changed in the past 80 years, it's just a man. Yeah, and frightening."
127,127,Speaker 5,F,00:53:25,"Oh yes, totally."
128,128,Speaker 2,M,00:53:29,"see these films that come out, you know, robots."
129,129,Speaker 4,M,00:53:41,"But a very Victorian upbringing wouldn't even have electric vehicle guests if that oil lamps, no wireless or anything like that."
130,130,Speaker 2,M,00:53:53,"it's kind of my generation now. You know, I mean, I can't imagine having a television since I was a toddler. But when microwave was coming you give me pause and think that now you feel like I can't give me that one?"
131,131,Speaker 4,M,00:54:11,"Well, my wife wouldn't have one she wouldn't use it to get the room microwave oven."
132,132,Speaker 3,F,00:54:16,"Well, I think everyone was horrified."
133,133,Speaker 2,M,00:54:19,"Well, I think we read you talk about radiation and not what you think. You find that you know what's going to happen."
134,134,Speaker 3,F,00:54:28,We were worried about what's coming out of the Blue Submarine.
135,135,Speaker 4,M,00:54:31,"So I went to my well, I spent most of her time in the spinning wheel to yeah, yeah, straight on the spinning room. And she was very well as well."
136,136,Speaker 4,M,00:54:41,"And frankly, that was"
137,137,Speaker 2,M,00:54:45,"in an antique shop in the day and the end of the old toys. You know, and it's just like this spring on it and this little bobbing on it, you know, it was kids entertainment. Then, you know, and then you try and get a kid now like you one of them night that five year old knows how to use a computer about the knowledge. And it's. Oh yes. So I do have dyslexia, you know, so I struggle with things and not very retellings have to be told this is what you've got to do. Something finished telling me I've forgotten the first part. You know, so I don't know what going to be like in seventy years. I've no idea."
138,138,Speaker 2,M,00:55:50,That that scares me. I want to run a self-drive car sitting in a car andI can't control the steering wheel which is moving along the motorway that terrifies me. I like to be in control.
139,139,Speaker 2,M,00:56:09,"Well, we are in a way because we, you know, somebody at the front and control. You know that because that is"
140,140,Speaker 4,M,00:56:18,You don't know that on the docklands light rail that drives itself.
141,141,Speaker 2,M,00:56:30,"Yeah. And when you talk about planes without pilots, I mean, I won't even go on a plane anyway, you know, with the pilot"
142,142,Speaker 5,F,00:56:39,"of these cars. Driverless cars? Yeah. But you know, there's not a lot goes wrong with the mechanics of the computer. Who do you blame in? And I think both someone killed recently."
143,143,Speaker 5,F,00:56:53,"Yeah, that was yes. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. I wouldn't know. Did frighten me. Right? The Wi-Fi goes down. You go, Okay,."
144,144,Speaker 2,M,00:57:02,"If I get in the left hand drive car. Yeah. Even though I know so many drive, you know where I'll be banging my feet on the floor when you go to a break and you just instinctively think you've been driving for a long time. Yeah. And I mean, even get my car out of an adapted factory to be left for the accelerator and the brake, and for 40 years I've been driving."
145,145,Speaker 5,F,00:57:27,How did you get on doing that? Because they tried me with it?
146,146,Speaker 2,M,00:57:31,It was easier than I thought.
147,147,Speaker 5,F,00:57:34,I wrote off the gearbox.
148,148,Speaker 2,M,00:57:37,"What I did before I got the car, I got in touch with a driving school that caters for disabled people. And when I got in the car and I said, Look, I'll be driving this in seventy nine, I said. Now the problem, do not say anything about my driving this bad. Tell me, but I don't want to be criticised, you know, because you have old habits and drive you driving your own way. And I was a bit edgy, $40 a throw, and it was only a tiny little car, you know, and I thought, I'm going to do wheelies and I brake I brake too sharp, so I have to concentrate on that. Then the car got the Nissan Qashqai sitting in there. It looks massive extra to get it. OK, now driving that for a couple of weeks, I was nervous. Is that on the road? Because trying to get out of style where I live onto the main road and I'm waiting for traffic to grow. I've got a gap and I just hit it slightly too hard. We're spending trying to get out, but now no problem."
149,149,Speaker 5,F,00:58:53,"Well, what they did with me because I can drive by right next. I can swap to. So the process was 19. Yeah. And occasionally the automatic. What do you do? I panicked because it took me straight out into the main road which I did think it was stupid. Yeah. And so I was I was I was nervous, so it didn't make any sense. What don't you do with an automatic car?"
150,150,Speaker 5,F,00:59:21,"Yeah, I've done my right leg suddenly burst into life, I suppose."
151,151,Speaker 2,M,00:59:26,"Yeah, I've done that. Come up, take Pulling away the automatic changed gear."
152,152,Speaker 5,F,00:59:36,"Into face to face, so to drive. But yeah,"
153,153,Speaker 2,M,00:59:40,"it was the first time I drove an automatic car. Not adapted. Yeah, not a standard automatic car wasn't concentrated as it pulled away before it went to the clutch. I hit the foot brake. Yeah, I mean, by the way, through the windscreen fortunate to the seatbelt umm"
154,154,Speaker 2,M,01:00:04,"Oh, well, then you go on that. Yeah, it was just  you're naturally link stink when you're driving. In some betting. You can just get in the car. You don't think about anything. You can get and off you go, All right. And again, with all that I'm going off to Manchester in a couple of weeks. Yeah, I've never been further than IKEA Exeter and looked a bit nervous on the A38 driving fast I don't know why. I mean, there's going to be in Manchester I don't know how how many times it's just one go basically."
155,155,Speaker 5,F,01:00:43,"I can't drive now, it's one of the drive and you just really. Quite dangerous. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am not supposed to drive anyway."
156,156,Speaker 2,M,01:00:55,"Yeah, well, I've got mobility scooter that I use in town quite a lot you know, but I'll throw in the big free cash flow and."
157,157,Speaker 1,M,01:01:04,I've got an ability scooter as well. Things I don't know. I would have come on that today ...
158,158,Speaker 2,M,01:01:17,"Well, that's it. I've got daily fit to motorbike change. So when I finally managed to keep my scooter outside anyway, I'll change it off. yeah. even if it just showed a sign outside the shop that changed to that, you know? Yes, I've been very fortunate to have the ..."
159,159,Speaker 2,M,01:03:28,"The other robot brought was a cat. It was a cat seating on your lap. We have to right be outside TG. This is nine to nine this is not what the carer describes it's coming back...She wanted to buy it. So she wanted to buy it. That was a hundred sixty pounds. Other robot like this you did with Astro came in and said...Well, she locked the cap and she wanted it to buy it. And she says to Hazel I've got the money here and I'll give you the money  laughs it's safe to. They give it to Eric. He can sort it...laughs"
160,160,Speaker 4,M,01:04:17,"I know, a bit of a dinosaur. I'm quite frightened for the future over there. Well, I think technology has advanced far too rapidly."
161,161,Speaker 2,M,01:04:26,"Well, I think that's probably where a lot of people struggle with it. Either don't do that and I don't put PCH a big grade with doing the computer courses where they but there's a lot of places on the dome, but you got to pay to go and it can be very expensive. So,."
162,162,Speaker 5,F,01:04:49,People are supposed to deliver houses and so they don't do well.
163,163,Speaker 2,M,01:04:54,"No, no. I mean, I always felt well, not always but recently the PCH felt a bit get a bit too controlling over us now. Yeah. When the rules change because of covid, we don't get told until a month after and we have a lot of us are desperate to get back to the coffee mornings and the bingo afternoon we can use the community room. We can't just use the kitchen. And I said, Well, Bring your coach down for tea and coffee, you know? And I'm borrowing a cow out in the courtyard. Oh, OK. A lot more can carry hot drinks on their own, you know, so they I got so oh, you can't do that."
164,164,Speaker 5,F,01:05:38,"Well, what about this is the percentage of buildings with these thermal cups? Yeah, you can get some of them is what we're trying to do is say thank you can how even though the sort of thing and bring your own drink, you know how it's going to work because honestly, I'm just like, I just manage, yeah. And if I go to shows and stuff, oh, well, we're going to try and find to have those cardboard trays thinking about it so we can help people."
165,165,Speaker 2,M,01:06:09,"Yeah, right. I've got a cup holder which clips up the week and the wheelchair."
166,166,Speaker 5,F,01:06:15,"Oh, have you?"
167,167,Speaker 2,M,01:06:16,"And I got it with a thermal cup. So the thermal cup  will fit in there. You can buy them. Usually Because you can adjust, you can adjust the the whole, you know, the the clip on it. Um, whether they want that, I don't know. I mean, if you was a guy, I've got thermal cups mine are that old now. No, they don't overheat that much. Um, but like you said, talking to my sister last night, she said, Well, you know, I thought if we got thermal cups then you can bring it down, a lot of them got what they call them..."
168,168,Speaker 2,M,01:07:12,"What we're saying is, you know, like, maybe this was a sale in the courtyard. A lot of them can't bring hot drinks down. I've suggested they put the the tea and the coffee in their own cups bring it down now, Boiler Co in the courtyard. But Debbie said, No, you can't do that. Do that. I don't understand why. Well, yeah."
169,169,Speaker 2,M,01:09:28,I've got about anybody else.
170,170,Speaker 5,F,01:09:31,"I think I have made my kitchen was not there. So I think that the wheelchair in the house is one thing. But if you will, in the future, going to have to have mobility equipment like I have a walker as well a space around and that you the units and of that can be dropped if you like can be lowered and which might have been so I can sit in the wheelchair does under certain types of kitchen things that my oven I can't have one with the dropped down door , it's not safe for me, but I have one of those those sliding they are brilliant. So that's socially but not so you can just explain it is cheap, and."
171,171,Speaker 1,M,01:10:26,I didn't quite understand what this door is.
172,172,Speaker 5,F,01:10:29,"Have you ever seen bake off the bake off it, right? What they do, but be put an oven door down what it does disappears underneath it slides underneath.Yeah, because I can't have anything in front of me. I've got to be able to be right in front of the oven book because it slides on. I think it's called Hide and Slide or something like that."
173,173,Speaker 1,M,01:10:50,"Yeah, I understand."
174,174,Speaker 5,F,01:10:51,"And it's it's excellent for that unless you hang on to it. If you try to move on, it goes and slides and, you know, expect it will go on the issue. But the other thing is, what about that? But it's it's brilliant for that because I can go in front and in the wheelchair, sometimes not too heavy. I go to the side. So the kitchen equipment, I think, and otherwise I wouldn't use the oven. It's as simple as that and it's got to be easily accessible."
175,175,Speaker 5,F,01:11:37,"If you look in technology and internet stuff it's kind of sounds awful generations come and go as they age, they will be brought up with this man. It's the wall of the rest of us. So the older ones now generation today, the generation that the older generation that I'm no longer the older again generation, maybe that has never used the internet and are still frightened of it, but that will adapto us, yeah, but as the years go on. Sounds awful. As the new generations come up they will, they will embrace all of this. And which we maybe not"
176,176,Speaker 2,M,01:12:21,"answerable now like the zoom. I mean, it might be simpler than the same I've never used zoom We've used a different type of media thing to use, but weren't operating now the guy who runs our mention he was operating it sometimes successfully, sometimes not. It is technical technology challenge if you like, love it laughs. The colleague I'm talking about. Well, it's. That sort of thing, if somebody said to me, Oh, you need to get on to this, you need to get on to that. That scares me. Like you say, it does scare you technology, am I going to be using computers for about 22 years and I'm still just scratching the surface. I can do e-mails."
177,177,Speaker 2,M,01:13:13,"I don't know what it is. I think it's a fear of the unknown. And you read about all the scams. But I mean, I can do the basics. I can send the emails attachments, I can open the emails. So to me, I can do what's important to me. Um."
178,178,Speaker 5,F,01:13:30,But it's not what it's about. Why would you have to if you're doing enough to meet your needs? That's what it's about.
179,179,Speaker 2,M,01:13:40,"It does for me. You know, like I say, I use my phone to do it. I've got a laptop not used for about three years. I've got a tablet. I get a struggle on that when trying to get onto the home page I need. I used to ask a friend to bring them up, saying I'm struggling come around, he sort everything out for me. I don't see him now. and the other friend that did it. And unfortunately, she passed away. So I feel like I'm on my own now and I feel really at a loss because where I live, I'm probably one of the youngest. You know, so there are some who use the internet, but mainly for shopping or ordering food online. And that's it. No, I don't do that. You know, I'm old fashioned, so I just like to, uh. I'm happy with what I can do But there were a couple of time later on when I make stuck in the house and I need to do more on the computers and things like that, and I just don't absorb it there. I do have a problem with dyslexia, but I know what the government member is."
180,180,Speaker 2,M,01:14:57,"To me at the moment is helpful, but there are people that have made that go insane. It's all. And I think people do struggle with it."
181,181,Speaker 1,M,01:15:08,I struggle with that. Yeah.
182,182,Speaker 3,F,01:15:10,"You know, so if it's like you say, it's what you said, so you need to give it. You want older people to embrace it as because they don't need it, make it easier. Make it less scary. Yeah, they get that. Sometimes these iPhones. I mean, I love it. I'm a geek. Yeah. As soon as therie is a new technology I want it! But I'm lucky enough to become A.. I've got friends that was so, you know, can't understand it. The technical wording is too difficult if you make it simple wording. Yet I just say press number one press number two fine. Why would you just interface? You know this? I love it, but I don't understand a lot of it. Make it easy. We want older people or people who are scared of it to to embrace the technology. Make it every dayable. Yeah, if that makes sense. Right?"
183,183,Speaker 4,M,01:16:20,"Maybe some people are scared by technology, including me. Some people are not like Hazel or she doesn't know about technology."
184,184,Speaker 2,M,01:16:31,Not as good as critics.
185,185,Speaker 4,M,01:16:33,"For example, I think it will become to some extent now. We don't see on the news all the hundreds and hundreds of people who are losing their life savings through internet banking. And they are."
186,186,Speaker 2,M,01:16:46,"Yes, I saw on the news with the eBay alone in the southwest, £25million stolen through scammers that we see in the southwest. You know, I've been ripped off. Nothing massive. The first one was about twenty five pound instead of six ninety nine. So I'm very dubious of what I go on to buy anything. And so it's very rare buying if you online, I go radiates cover for one of the residents. I'm supposed to be near to the. He didn't want to do it. He wanted me to do it. Yes, it looked the same. I was getting to the point where I was looking at the scene and I thought, I don't recognise that company name and don't recognise that company name. So I rang up my sister she said tribe from world. Don't do radiates covers, what they do, and you get special offers, so I ordered in that we've got it. So the next one he wants we'll order through the same company because we know it's genuine. Yeah."
187,187,Speaker 5,F,01:17:50,"Don't you find it like your eyes on ebay, as you said, Oh, there's marvellous tablet! It should be £700 for £200 if you think you're going to get the genuine thing £200..."
188,188,Speaker 2,M,01:18:02,"No. You know, if it sounds too good to be true, then it is."
189,189,Speaker 2,M,01:18:30,Stairs without banisters for me. So especially without was a bit of banisters to.
190,190,Speaker 4,M,01:18:39,"Well, I wouldn't be without my handrails up the stairs now, and I didn't ask for. Oh, I've no reason to rub it down, but about four bypasses I've lost all my energy to having had colon cancer twice an insulin dependent diabetic. All sorts of things. And when I was last in hospital, they certainly organised at all these rails and I couldn't do without them now. But you know, I manage if but they were then and."
191,191,Speaker 2,M,01:19:09,"I couldn't even let me stay and I can't. I've got two options, you know,."
192,192,Speaker 5,F,01:19:12,"So I've got bars all around my house, even if that's possible, because when I go home, I've tried to make myself show for like four stuff stuff. Yeah, I think wherever I put my hand and, well, I set up. That's why we need your help when you come in the hole every everywhere around the world. So do not think you should design. So let's make it open. Right. But I'm going to go around the outside world. Yeah, because everybody everywhere I put my hand, I need a handrail. Yeah, there's basic, that's not technology, that's just"
193,193,Speaker 4,M,01:19:47,"and whatever people might say about PCH. I mean, saying this year, but I found the wonderful, Oh yeah, yeah, I'm the beast and I own the property. I don't own the sort of walls and things, but that where I had a problem, they've done marvellous. The job and charge me quarter is because they have taken the bathroom and it was coming from the maisonette above mine and they spent four days with plumbers and carpenters."
194,194,Speaker 2,M,01:20:15,"You yeah, you don't got a landlord. I mean, it is it. I was in associations, you know, as great as I'm going to put it words, which is helpful if you like as PCH. Yeah. And I know what they like. I work for it and now give me landlords, you know, and go with being grateful to like Hazel. Yeah, organising quizzes and things like that. Our place. Um, I mean, I know that's not to do with a lot of this."
195,195,Speaker 5,F,01:21:16,"So you've got stairless, haven't you? It is not the one that goes up to the floor. And I think we have seen that. We've got that. Yeah. So it goes, that is lovely."
196,196,Speaker 2,M,01:21:29,"Yeah, I've seen that in a DIY. Big S.O.S. Big. Yes, I think we've got a lift right goes right through to where he needs it, you know? That's brilliant. So outside lifts, you've got stairs outside haven't you? and you."
197,197,Speaker 6,F,01:21:46,"Look by my own house, yeah, so."
198,198,Speaker 2,M,01:21:49,"And you can get these external ones that take you off. It's like a stair's lift, but it's external"
199,199,Speaker 3,F,01:21:55,The one I'm thinking about to move back to the stairs up on the outside is a public footpath. Uh-Huh. Yeah. So that's a different part.
200,200,Speaker 5,F,01:22:07,"We couldn't adapt where I used to be. I have what I have now because some of those that go through the others say that the future builds. It's already in place and things, but it's not like they can't be adapted. So this oh we need it to be installed."
201,201,Speaker 4,M,01:22:27,"I also think it's important to appreciate what we've got. Yeah, I mean, yesterday, for example, if the gardener all day doing the gardens in the patch where I live, which is a big area with the dust bins in the middle, in a cage, and if we go up to the garden to have a cup of tea or coffee, you can do no wrong, you know?"
202,202,Speaker 2,M,01:22:47,"Yeah, they're not allowed to stop for tea breaks. Well, not on official tea breaks."
203,203,Speaker 1,M,01:22:56,Awesome. Really good.
204,204,Speaker 2,M,01:22:58,"Yeah. Very helpful. Even the ranges of caretakers. I know we can't I'm not allowed to come into your properties or if you need something, take it away, you can get outside your front door. The  communal , you know, and."
205,205,Speaker 1,M,01:23:18,And if they were to pick up steak every morning picking up the litter at nine o'clock. Wow. Yeah. Emptied the bins every couple of days.
206,206,Speaker 2,M,01:23:24,"Yeah, yeah. So you know, we got we do get a lot of help. It is really, you know. Well, I suppose there will come a time when I feel for it. Some people will need to move because of the environment that it may not be suitable for them now."
207,207,Speaker 2,M,01:23:48,"It's hard to say because we all we all have different disabilities or health. I mean, we had a lady in our class. She was totally blind. And if you're having a coffee morning or bingo after you come down, play bingo. Somebody go for one of the residents of Walton, go and bring it down and take it back up again and ..."
208,208,Speaker 3,F,01:24:11,"I am about to have the bathroom changed because it's something I physically need. Yeah, and you said about being able to stay where I am. Yes, if I get worse, then the equipment that's being fitted, it can be again. I think this phrase know it's coming from a future group. They can adjust it so I can stay where I am, so I'm going to need. It's probably at some stage a way of showering and this new equipment can't be and have an add on so I can stay where I won't need help to be showered. So I'm keeping into handles. So that's important"
209,209,Speaker 3,F,01:25:04,"it will be based solely on this idea of being checked being built next week, and it's the hardest part of the electric service and Flamingo is once that's done and it looks perfectly normal. But if I get worse, they can adjust they can block put something onto that'll  help me, which again is thinking ahead."
210,210,Speaker 2,M,01:25:28,Improvements?
211,211,Speaker 3,F,01:25:29,"Yeah, thinking ahead. Yes, these things are built and put in it's thinkable ok. What like Bath? Possibly what you're saying? What do we need to put in now just in case? Yeah, I don't know if you understand."
212,212,Speaker 3,F,01:26:00,Sorry.
213,213,Speaker 5,F,01:26:07,"It's lucky that you live where you are, where I am. I'm coming down my bedroom world and I have for 12 months and I've been trying to get it. I have reported it and they keep saying Yes, yes, we'll do it. I've had scaffolding outside my flat for about 14 months. Nothing to do with me. It was a flat blow that took them a long time to cure their down. Yeah, when I said, Well, why can't you expand it because it sounds like no, why can't you expand it? Oh, no, all the scaffolding has got to come down and we'll just build a separate little one for you. Oh, how stupid! The scaffolding came down last week, but I don't know where I'm going to get mine. They are all removed."
214,214,Speaker 5,F,01:27:03,"It's not mould, it is just the black strips."
215,215,Speaker 2,M,01:27:07,But it can turn to mould
216,216,Speaker 5,F,01:27:09,"Yeah, and I have this severe case where and oh yes, it is definitely damp. It needs to be done. It's coming through the outside cladding."
217,217,Speaker 3,F,01:27:16,"Yeah, but it could spot, I think, what you're saying. It could be that if you go too bad, they have to say yes, it's not suitable for it to stay. Yeah. So they need to put it right."
218,218,Speaker 2,M,01:27:28,"That can affect your respiratory system, you know, breathe breathing and everything else you do."
219,219,Speaker 6,F,01:27:35,Do you pay rent ?
220,220,Speaker 3,F,01:27:37,"No, it's my own flat, but we're going to come on those factory housing."
221,221,Speaker 2,M,01:27:43,"Oh, yeah, so you're at you're like leaseholder."
222,222,Speaker 3,F,01:27:50,"Uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
223,223,Speaker 2,M,01:27:56,"Yeah, I don't know whether that's how to get things done. Yeah, there's a rent payer. I don't know, you know, but you do find that it would be hard if you to get things done."
224,224,Speaker 4,M,01:28:10,I've never found it difficult to get things done. I tend to put it in writing. I write a fancy letter to the little department of PCH. And I think that's better than a telephone call.
225,225,Speaker 2,M,01:28:21,"Oh, yes. Different landlords, again, the different levels of what they will do and what they want."
226,226,Speaker 4,M,01:28:29,And they've now just in the past week introduced a leasehold forum which is on Zoom. Yeah. And are you going to have a personal personal contact if you're a leaseholder to discuss any problems that might come up.
227,227,Speaker 2,M,01:28:56,"Yeah, of course if it's more regular. laughs"
228,228,Speaker 6,F,01:28:59,"Yes, absolutely. I suppose we're looking at, we get a bus every half an hour."
229,229,Speaker 2,M,01:29:03,"Yeah. The thing I I don't use buses now, but I've heard a lot of complaints from some of the residents. The post that goes from town to 25, I think, is a one to the Barbican and the Hoe."
230,230,Speaker 4,M,01:29:15,You have to be fine.
231,231,Speaker 2,M,01:29:17,"And they went to use the normal single decker bus. In the summer they're using in the tourist bus. And then when the tourist bus comes and it's full up. Yeah, the regular people who live around there want to get to the doctors at West Hoe, can't get on the bus. Mm-Hmm. Mm hmm. And because of that, you know, enough, I think, is stupid. You don't need that. You can have the tourist bus on, but keep the 25 the normal service going instead of swapping it. You know,"
232,232,Speaker 6,F,01:29:48,there aren't the amount of seats on the blue buses downstairs.
233,233,Speaker 2,M,01:29:50,"No, there isn't no there. So you get a lot less seats."
234,234,Speaker 6,F,01:29:54,"I mean, you see people that are able to stand but they're still using seats. Yeah, yeah, that's interesting."
235,235,Speaker 2,M,01:30:02,"So that, you know, that's here. I mean, I don't know about the rest, about the town and other areas. You know, I know you get some areas where the bus is every half an hour, and it can be every hour"
236,236,Speaker 4,M,01:30:15,"You get unlucky, within five metres of my front door there's a bus every 10 minutes. The 51 or the 21."
237,237,Speaker 5,F,01:30:22,"Yeah, I have to ask, what does Pepper think? Because his head is this is kind of, you know, he's looking down"
238,238,Speaker 2,M,01:30:38,It  is just too many red? Yeah. laughs
239,239,Speaker 5,F,01:30:48,"It just gives you a right look, and .."
240,240,Speaker 3,F,01:31:31,"Oh, I think the facilitators is accessibility and that covers what you were saying about accessibility, and that's allowing for people like Gaynor to stay where she is, and she has to be able to use and things like that. And it's making it technology accessible as well. Mm hmm. So it's fair to say the barriers is the inaccessibility to those things."
241,241,Speaker 3,F,01:32:19,"I love what you say about the house. Is that the future proofed? Yes. Yeah. We want more of that because we are an ageing population. Yeah. Yeah, we."
242,242,Speaker 5,F,01:32:33,"It's already in place, we keep coming back to this thing, but it's you're off."
243,243,Speaker 6,F,01:32:39,"You might also make one comment about the accessibility and I mean, I know this room because the astronomical society used to meet in this room and I belong to that we had a long time, but it just doesn't seem to be a hearing in this room."
244,244,Speaker 1,M,01:33:00,That's right.
245,245,Speaker 5,F,01:33:08,Absolutely right. I noticed that. Yeah.
246,246,Speaker 6,F,01:33:11,"But I mean, simple people in here were wearing hearing aids. But there isn't any hearing loop here.  A hearing loop is something that you  fix in the room, it's not difficult, you put wires all around the room. We have one in the church, and so people with wearing hearing aids, they can set their hearing aid to the new system and then they can hear it might be worth mentioning this to university."
247,247,Speaker 2,M,01:34:14,"we have that problem on our face. So when you get a group of people sat down just talking amongst themselves. And then somebody's phone rings. And she talked about the fact that I can't hear you, there is too much noise. People I feel like say, Well, don't stay here on your phone. Go somewhere where it's quiet. They don't. You know you're right about these hearing aids. I've heard about, you know what? I don't need them. I just don't listen"
248,248,Speaker 6,F,01:34:47,"to him just yet. Yes, you should be like in our church yet we're hearing aids. And she said it's the hidden disability, and she wear them for the service and as soon as the service was out, she's taken them off and goes,"
249,249,Speaker 2,M,01:35:03,"Well, but is it an invisible disability? People don't notice."
250,250,Speaker 6,F,01:35:07,"but they don't have a lot of patience with usual deaf. with blind people she can always... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
251,251,Speaker 2,M,01:35:16,"Something I suppose I've learnt living where I live with people. We've been hearing aids and someone say, Can you speak up or or can you seat on this side to make? Because that's be good. It has to be bad, you know,."
252,252,Speaker 6,F,01:35:30,"or speak more slowly. Yeah, I mean, I'm finding that with the telephone. You know, these companies occasionaly rang, and I get blown and I say, please start again slowly."
253,253,Speaker 3,F,01:35:41,"Yeah, yeah, I'm lucky with my phone, I press on something and then it comes out very loud,."
254,254,Speaker 6,F,01:35:49,"But OK, so OK, you have used technology to help you."
255,255,Speaker 2,M,01:38:28,Some people think of ISO because  I've hearing loop in the communal room.
256,256,Speaker 3,F,01:38:34,Yes. Yes.
257,257,Speaker 5,F,01:38:36,"I just said about physical places. And I have to say it's a criticism of the university. Where I live my home, I can only live one door away because threshold strips. Mm. Yeah. And I'm talkative I couldn't get out of the kitchen,  because the designers need to think, of, this is my soapbox. There are too many able bodied designers designing for disabled people. Yeah, they need to sit in a wheelchair and go round themselves. So that's just my soapbox that it might be. What I have come today. I had a real struggle to find somewhere to get to get in and to come out of the and the Cafe out the cafe. Yeah. You get to live with that. Yeah, yeah."
258,258,Speaker 2,M,01:39:35,"Yeah. I would worry about catching me. I've got new leg, which we only got yesterday. I worried about catching that on these walking behind me. Careful, careful. You know, like you say, if you're in a wheelchair..."
259,259,Speaker 5,F,01:39:51,"A  big thing for yourself, I'm looking at the factors you're looking at, for me to stay there what was said to me recently? It's all right. The fire brigade will get you just get over the threshold to stand outside. So that way gonna happen. It's something that I'm fighting at the minute. Yeah, it's a big issue. And it might has been adapted for me, both ongoing and there's a few blows. This is the same. It's not only once inside, it's getting in and out, which is also an issue, and you've got stairs and stuff and something you can't get out it's something you never get over. But whereas I would have thought reasonable to adapt or to adjust, and that is a reason to stay where if I would have to move, I'm lucky it can be done. But there are places if you want to stay in your own home, there has to be a way of making from this part of accessibility not only in where you live, getting in and I'm sure that that makes sense."
260,260,Speaker 5,F,01:41:22,"I'm working on this at the minute,"
261,261,Speaker 4,M,01:41:25,"but what I find very helpful with cooking, particularly in the sense that, you know,."
262,262,Speaker 2,M,01:41:38,"One in the hallway and one in the bathroom we've got Pendants Show. We've got we've got also got wristbands, which you can use. Um, I was given a wristband. Yeah. So many run my flat number. It comes through the intercom I can answer it without getting off the chair. press it once to speak to the person you know you. Plus a second time when the doors open, which I thought it was fantastic. I'd never seen that before."
263,263,Speaker 5,F,01:42:10,"That's well, first, that comes back to self-care, but well to tell you when someone says the word, isn't it? You go, Oh yes, to stay where I am, if I have a problem, if I do well enough to comfort me, rock, as you say, get to know me. If I fall there is a technology, I can get home. But without that, you didn't have somebody like that who taught me that's have to go the care home."
264,264,Speaker 2,M,01:42:43,"Some people have to pay for that out their own pocket, don't they?"
265,265,Speaker 5,F,01:42:47,"It's not too bad. It's not cheap, I used to pay."
266,266,Speaker 2,M,01:42:49,I don't know. I don't know. I know in Marlborough how some people in the flat say
267,267,Speaker 4,M,01:42:56,"Mm. Yeah. But I found very useful that cooking is my oven packed up and I bought a new one. I bought a Hotpoint It cost me a hundred quid on the internet that was all. And it had this facility, which I find invaluable, and that is when I put something under the grill, I then put the timer on. Yeah, but it switched itself off. So so now where I've previously I forgot about it and it just had burnt bacon. it's not done perfectly because I know exactly how many minutes it was it switched iself off, so often they try to get carried away watching something for example."
268,268,Speaker 5,F,01:43:34,"My hob, every ring on my hob I can set a timer on and it would go off."
269,269,Speaker 2,M,01:43:46,"We've got our alarms going off. Oh yeah, because somebody fell asleep on the sofa and that's something on the hob, wherever, you know. And it's a brilliant idea. Yeah. I mean, if I'm doing chips in a chip pan, I don't like these fryers. It's the horrible thing. I like your standard chip pan. I stand by that cooker from start to finish, then you get often. But I'm fortunate I can do that, you know, again. So it's hard for me to say what barriers may come in front of me that 20 years."
270,270,Speaker 5,F,01:44:24,"Why if every time I've put something on the hob, but if I have to leave the kitchen, and the chance of that cliff, would you not believe it? But like the open, it's perfect if you remember to do it. Oh, the grill, the oven to set because I know I have to because of the technology on that is absolutely out of control"
271,271,Speaker 2,M,01:44:46,I might be able to draw a line at low
272,272,Speaker 5,F,01:44:50,Each hob I could turned off in time.
273,273,Speaker 2,M,01:44:51,"I haven't got the manual for it and that was given to me. If you're two years old and it was given to me, and so I would give it to you from the air fryer to a proper conventional cooker, which I've always liked. So I don't know whether it was this guy. I know it's got a timer on running for the oven, whether it's for anything else on that, I don't know. I can probably download the manual for it. Oh, I thought you was saying that."
274,274,Speaker 5,F,01:47:31,"It's it's it's getting it's getting worse as hard as times going on the stopping you just using the phone and you're being forced into it, which I think is wrong. But to do this, it's not to be human. Yes, and that's where I live there. But there are a lot of people who say I called that one particular service pool and said, we call this all medication, and they said, Well, we're not going to do this anymore. And that is wrong. Go online doing an e-consult. I am speaking to the doctor. I have to do. So want to hear how many people are falling sick because of it? And I think that is a huge barrier and it is causing people to go to the special care, because they're not being as that. What we don't mind coming up to date a doctor place isn't great. But outside agencies have also got to realise they've got to. We're not all. On the same page is that we're not using the technology."
275,275,Speaker 2,M,01:48:38,"Can I think something? It's not my it's been a relative inclusion actually. Having come to me, ask me, I have no idea that, you know, when you're saying you need to say your GP service? Yeah, go username, password. Yeah. And sometime in which is going come into a password not recognised and it and then you should turn out. Her son checked her computer it wasn't her computer, it was a GP sensor, it was. There is a code and she couldn't get through to a doctor and she needed medication urgently nebuliser, you know, um, I've never used mine since it went online. I've never used it. Not that I don't want to. I don't even know what the website address is, so I have to ring them open. Ask them where you can get through. Um, that's the problem. You know, technical stuff, folks, and stuff like that. If the system's going down. Yeah. To Ringo, oh, you'd have to try again tomorrow. Love to try again tomorrow. An actual person, you could be dead by tomorrow. You know, I mean, not everybody knows it when you're feeling unwell, it's life threatening. Yeah. And you're ringing the GP because you don't want to bother your neighbours."
276,276,Speaker 4,M,01:50:04,"The other thing is, the older we get, I think safety is very, very important, you know? Yeah, I when I moved into my place, I bought myself from the re-use centre in Union Street, a tumble dryer. I paid ten quid for it. Yeah. And I got it home and it worked. I look on the internet and it was suspect to fire. Yeah. So I ran the Whirlpool and I said, Look, I've got a tumble dryer of yours and you say it's one of the other risks. So they said that's all right give me the serial number, and within two weeks they did bring me a new one."
277,277,Speaker 2,M,01:50:38,"Oh, that's fair enough! laughs"
278,278,Speaker 6,F,01:50:39,"OK. I know. Yeah, but you were able to ring them up. That's right. Yeah. You think if they had?"
279,279,Speaker 5,F,01:50:46,"Yeah, yeah, you hadn't realised that the word risk was."
280,280,Speaker 2,M,01:50:50,"That's right. Are a lot of time. You've got to go on the internet to find the phone number so. Yeah, it does happen. Yeah, I got news. I bought a scooter that can run from better life. Yeah. Lloyd's chemist used to sell,"
281,281,Speaker 3,F,01:51:53,"There's going to be a follow up session, I guess."
282,0,Speaker 1,F,00:04:38,"Well, this. Well, you don't want any meal kit now."
283,1,Speaker 2,F,00:04:46,"You want your independence. Yeah, yeah. So it's been kind of a bit of freedom as well. You know, you've worked all your life lived all your life independently and then to get somebody else to be telling you what you should be doing. Yeah. You know, while you can still do it yourself, you understand?"
284,2,Speaker 3,F,00:05:04,Having your kids do it on the phone.
285,3,Speaker 1,F,00:05:06,"Oh yeah. I don't want to be sat in a chair then, and old people just want when it's time."
286,4,Speaker 4,F,00:05:27,"I think if you live in a home and you really become institutionalised, you know, I I mean, I know many people that have moved to the home and they were they were finaly independent in their own home, but they've completely changed when they go into their homes. That's one reason why I want to stay in my own home."
287,5,Speaker 1,F,00:05:49,"And, you know, people could stay longer independently in their own home, but still might need a bit of support, like a bit of a care package, somebody coming in, maybe just to check on them, not necessarily to do something for them, but just to check their all right. And they've taken the medication, you know, and that helps them stay longer. They don't actually want somebody in there."
288,6,Speaker 1,F,00:06:20,"But that's that can be quite spooky as well, because I've worked with people with dementia and they put in place different needs to keep them safe at home, like. They they made a recording of their daughter's voice, prompting them to take their medication. Yeah, and it's like that. Well, that can be spooky. If you've got dementia you suddenly got your daughter talking at 10 o'clock at night. Yeah. You she then spent the next few hours looking for her."
289,7,Speaker 2,F,00:06:49,"No. You know, there was like sensor pads in the bed. But if you set it for eight o'clock in the morning and if you weren't at that bed by 8:30, you get a prompt for what we would like laying but  you know. That type of thing, we have physically seen where voice is coming from. I think here is as an adverse effect on a lot of people."
290,8,Speaker 3,F,00:07:15,"I've found too. My aunt's got dementia and I was talking to her on the phone when she was still answering the phone and she'd be going on about these people cooking all these lovely meals and then drinking my wine, she said. I've paid for it. They never offered me any and I never get the meal. I was really surprised about this because she got a carer and I wasn't too sure of. And then it tweaked I said: have you got and it was John and Lisa on cooking on a Saturday morning on the television, and she said the television was was real. It took me a while to dig in because she is..."
291,9,Speaker 4,F,00:08:06,"Did you say, Jill, that she had dementia?"
292,10,Speaker 3,F,00:08:09,"Yes, she said she got diagnosed"
293,11,Speaker 4,F,00:08:11,"with Alzheimer's dementia, it's very very difficult. You have to worry about a robot."
294,12,Speaker 5,F,00:08:30,"we deviate until she's got a brain. So much, much harder. Yes. Yes. So this is not what we are."
295,13,Speaker 5,F,00:08:55,Walking. Going outside and walking everyday you have to do.
296,14,Speaker 4,F,00:09:04,"Yeah, yeah, we do. When you took it, you did. Four of us here do Taichi, dancing."
297,15,Speaker 4,F,00:09:16,"I thought we'd been on hold. Yeah. Yeah. If we're walking for health today,"
298,16,Speaker 4,F,00:09:23,an we do DJ dancing. Don't forget our DJ dancing. Sorry because the racing is starting these days?
299,17,Speaker 3,F,00:09:31,"I think it's going out into the Fresh air. I say that. But if I just let you use it fresh off, they need you to just go out. Yeah, I think it's expensive that I think as a matter of law, you can you could use it as well. Yes, I can live outside well, it's 50 times what. But once you get to the stage when some things that might help stem"
300,18,Speaker 4,F,00:10:15,"You know the Taichi, with a lot of older people, they don't realise it, but it is so good for you. Oh yeah. Do you konw if you get something really wrong with you and you have a physio? Let's say a physio, most of the exercises they do is the same ones that we do at Taichi, and it's just ample. Do you agree that it's good for you?"
301,19,Speaker 4,F,00:10:39,"Because it's a social event as well, it's not just going for the exercise.It's a social adventure, it sounds lovely."
302,20,Speaker 1,F,00:10:53,"Sorry, we shouted out the poor boy."
303,21,Speaker 4,F,00:10:55,It's a man man. Laughs. We do all lessons.
304,22,Speaker 3,F,00:10:58,"I tell you what, we'll take you with the nap state."
305,23,Speaker 6,F,00:11:01,You can come on first.
306,24,Speaker 5,F,00:11:02,I think I did Taichi and like this. It's like some all gentle exercise. It's chinese.I did it in China and ...
307,25,Speaker 4,F,00:11:15,"give me a bouncing ball, fans, and sticks  and they are very ..."
308,26,Speaker 4,F,00:11:31,"All right. So is there another reason for going out is the communication, even if you have only have a few words with a stranger and say, Good morning, how are you? Because it's so like, OK, it's so easy when you're on your own to lose the power of speaking. If you like of having a conversation, if you're on your own all the time, you're just sharing a television set and you're not getting anything constructive back from it."
309,27,Speaker 4,F,00:12:01,So it is quite easy then over time to lose the art of conversation.
310,28,Speaker 6,F,00:12:07,I sit on your board as well if you want to put swimming.
311,29,Speaker 6,F,00:12:14,"Yeah, in the life centre swimming."
312,30,Speaker 5,F,00:12:20,"And that's that's good, because it's easier than most exercises, isn't it? swimming in the water"
313,31,Speaker 1,F,00:12:43,just walk around again. Hmm. I don't want to Taichi. I do volunteering and I I'm back at Food Bank.
314,32,Speaker 3,F,00:13:04,"Coating on footwear, self-care. Yes. Some people come when they go into the shoes to do the shoes ..."
315,33,Speaker 1,F,00:13:49,"Yeah, I think it's important to keep in mind up to this. Well, very important."
316,34,Speaker 1,F,00:14:00,"Puzzles, crosswords, reading. Mm hmm. Yeah. Well, all the media stuff."
317,35,Speaker 4,F,00:14:07,"You've also got to be able to adapt to a change in your lifestyle. Things that you could quite easily do with, you know, you have domestic chores, putting the garbage outside, things like that. Sometimes you've got to adapt and find a different way of doing something that you're able to do so that you can still carry on doing it. It's not causing you any distress or worry. Simple things like my son in law, my son in law, my grandson has just moved everything off the top shelf to the middle shelf, in the kitchen cupboard because I've shrunk a bit and I can't reach the top ones anymore. So he's put the ones I don't use very much up there and put all the"
318,36,Speaker 4,F,00:14:55,"Yeah. So that. Every time they come out, I'm not saying, can you get me this, can you get me that? Yeah, he's already then for me. So, you know, you've got to look to adapt rather than say, I can't do something. You've got to try and find a different way of doing it."
319,37,Speaker 6,F,00:15:27,You've got to be careful with walking as well because of the stairs and ...
320,38,Speaker 6,F,00:15:49,"It causes it for pure nativism because I always hated House, but I forgot how hard it was hard to get enthusiastic about all these days. Laughs."
321,39,Speaker 4,F,00:16:02,It can be soul destroying because you aren't going to do it again.
322,40,Speaker 1,F,00:16:05,What's that?
323,41,Speaker 4,F,00:16:06,House works.
324,42,Speaker 3,F,00:16:07,"Oh, I hate it. Well, nobody likes it.I don't know some people do."
325,43,Speaker 1,F,00:16:16,We get going.
326,44,Speaker 4,F,00:16:18,"I tell you what is missing, is family. Yeah. If you're seeing your grand children and things like that, that visual let you have done it."
327,45,Speaker 3,F,00:16:27,"Some people are unable to do that, all their children and grand children and family live away. So you know, you just have to get on with it and go on with it basically."
328,46,Speaker 4,F,00:16:40,"You say last week, my grand son rang me and said, Can you come for breakfast today? And then? Yeah, I'm quite lucky because mine are in Plymouth."
329,47,Speaker 4,F,00:16:52,"No. Yeah, no. Well, I could travel to Malta to see my son.. and I'm not comfortable with that."
330,48,Speaker 4,F,00:17:02,"Yeah, yeah. I've got some family in Plymouth and some family away. So I used to because the children at school and stuff and got activities, I usually travel up there."
331,49,Speaker 6,F,00:17:20,"it becomes a challenge when you get older, because well, for the last 10, 11 years, I've been travelling to Canada every year for so long, I've got family there. But then the more I think about it now, especially after Covid, it's out frames frame that he performed in schools, tested in students. I mean, I just think of them as 10 and a half hours long. Yes. Yeah. And I think as you get older, it's a bit more daunting that I never used to think about. Mm-Hmm. But I've got older. Yeah. Yeah, you've got something."
332,50,Speaker 4,F,00:18:02,You can see more obstacles in your way. Don't you?
333,51,Speaker 5,F,00:18:07,It always seems so much more effort. Do I really want to go?
334,52,Speaker 6,F,00:18:12,"I think it's because you can overthink things, can't you?"
335,53,Speaker 3,F,00:18:14,"Yeah, I think it's it's because of Covid, that's why? Well, mine is going for a long time, isn't it? so..."
336,54,Speaker 7,M,00:18:25,"Get to the airport, put my case in, next stop. You know, the bark."
337,55,Speaker 5,F,00:18:46,"I volunteer for the home for the blind. And going back to keeping mind active, they do a crossword every morning and they know what they want to do it because they know that it's going to keep their mind active. And I think that's very important for them."
338,56,Speaker 7,M,00:19:16,"Gardening, yes."
339,57,Speaker 4,F,00:19:17,"I have plenty to plant but I'm not a gardener. I was never a gardener before. I will do a bit more now. Now, though,."
340,58,Speaker 7,M,00:19:31,"She was fine. she was all right. I mean, the first plant landed upside down"
341,59,Speaker 4,F,00:19:47,"No. Yeah, I don't like it."
342,60,Speaker 1,F,00:20:41,"Three. Yeah. Okay. So so one could be for the mind. Yeah. The other is physical like exercises, swimming and ..etc."
343,61,Speaker 2,F,00:20:54,"Because that comes back with exercises in that section because that can cope with the dancing and Taichi, and all this, that is exercise, isn't it?"
344,62,Speaker 4,F,00:21:06,Another important one is family of friends. Yeah.
345,63,Speaker 1,F,00:21:09,"Socialising. Socialising, activity and your mind."
346,64,Speaker 2,F,00:21:16,"I'm still looking out for people that need help. Yeah, it's a bit of a helping in hand."
347,65,Speaker 3,F,00:21:21,"But they're the three things that are important, our minds, our physical, and  socialising"
348,66,Speaker 4,F,00:21:48,"Social interaction is important, I think."
349,67,Speaker 1,F,00:21:59,"Well, there is my grandson. Yeah, as a friend, just as a friend, there's all sorts for him. But the problem is  the man is working at is getting elderly and he couldn't hardly walk but he stopped trying to walk."
350,68,Speaker 1,F,00:22:20,"Which is sad. because, you know, I know, and my ..."
351,69,Speaker 7,M,00:22:38,"Well, sometimes you get, you know, a bit negative. Yeah, I like to say something serene. You know? Yeah, like I said, that is it. Right? Well, yeah. You know that all these, you know?"
352,70,Speaker 3,F,00:22:53,"This really really helping it, yeah, without them, I don't know what we ca do."
353,71,Speaker 1,F,00:22:57,Wow. Know you just need someone to encourage him...
354,72,Speaker 7,M,00:23:00,"Yeah, just get him off the chair and just sit outside in the fresh air saying, try it now, but I've tried to say, man instead of me doing it today, you do it. You know? But he's afraid of falling over. The guy fell over several times and of course.."
355,73,Speaker 6,F,00:23:21,"It takes away any aches and pains you've got, right. But in a sympathetic ear or an arm to ..."
356,74,Speaker 7,M,00:23:29,Got in touch with the right people? Yes. To one another. Yeah.
357,75,Speaker 1,F,00:23:33,No. He doesn't want. We won't go along with with them. He won't go to the trouble of it. He can't be bothered.
358,76,Speaker 3,F,00:23:46,"I think it comes at a time in everyone's life when. They give up. Yeah, yeah. But you can't try to encourage them. Yeah. And I think, yeah, they don't really want to do it."
359,77,Speaker 7,M,00:24:00,"He's been so independent because, I mean, he was he was in the Marines, but he's been so independent and helping other people before he needed himself and he doesn't like it."
360,78,Speaker 4,F,00:24:11,"It's hard to accept. Yes, he doesn't want to be a bother. He doesn't want to be? All these people are worse off than me?"
361,79,Speaker 5,F,00:40:46,With technology in Italy being scammed. That's what worries me one thing is scamming.
362,80,Speaker 3,F,00:40:52,"Yeah. The problem with technology, you've got to teach the elderly people  how to use it. Yeah, I have many friends who would be , umm, would help them to to join a Zoom meeting or face talk, but they don't know how to use the technology. And that is the problem with them."
363,81,Speaker 3,F,00:41:35,"They don't know, yes. I've just been teaching someone. I downloaded Zoom for her and then I showed her how it works. But before that, she didn't have a clue about how it worked."
364,82,Speaker 5,F,00:41:52,"OK, It's trying to get somebody to explain how it works. Yeah, in simple terms, don't use any jargon, you know, and have patience. Yes, do it slowly, and you might have to go over a couple of times. But there was a company, a phone company EE, that used to run workshops and teach people how to use it. But I don't know if any places now."
365,83,Speaker 1,F,00:42:29,"So technology is good. Yeah. But then you've got to know how to use it, and also be careful, being safe as well when you're using these things. That's my priority all the time."
366,84,Speaker 6,F,00:42:55,"There is increasing pressure, they're trying to get you to spend money over the computer or bank over the computer, and I eventually refuse."
367,85,Speaker 6,F,00:43:06,"I will not do them over the computer, and I refuse to do that. I'll end up having doodies under the bed if need be, but ..."
368,86,Speaker 5,F,00:43:17,"I tell you what makes me very sad about technology is when you hear these people, these women that get sucked in by these men for all this money. Laughs. It's true, isn't it?  that's true. Yeah."
369,87,Speaker 7,M,00:43:30,It works both for and.
370,88,Speaker 5,F,00:43:32,"No, I know but they must be some loosing in their mind. I mean, how could anybody let's say my age, think about a 28 year old man's going to fancy me when he couldn't get anybody."
371,89,Speaker 7,M,00:43:46,We never know. Laughs.
372,90,Speaker 5,F,00:43:53,How old you are? Like 20.
373,91,Speaker 4,F,00:43:58,"Oh, yeah, but he doesn't put his own picture on...Laughs."
374,92,Speaker 5,F,00:44:03,"You were laughing, you've probably done it. Well, you put your own photo up. laughs."
375,93,Speaker 3,F,00:44:28,"So they won't use the phone to phone up, say different companies, because they know you phone their number and then you've got five different menus. Press this one, press that one. And even then, you don't get through. Even if you press the right number, you don't get through a person. You're given another menu. Well, by that time, it's got so frustrating that you hang up."
376,94,Speaker 3,F,00:44:54,"I know I get frustrated when it comes the message. Thank you for your patience. I don't have any. Laughs.You are important to me, answer the phone then."
377,95,Speaker 7,M,00:45:03,"And this is often very, very commonly when we call our GP. It's so difficult to talk to your GP, I mean, you just end up in these terrible menus."
378,96,Speaker 3,F,00:45:14,"I think that's why a lot of people don't get in contact with their doctors because you're hanging on and hanging on 30-35 minutes is common. And then you've got the receptionist who say your GP  will phone back. but then you can't be sat by the phone for a whole day waiting for the call. You go and do one little job, and that's when they call. So, You back to square one. Yeah. You know, and I think a lot of older people maybe have issues that really need seen to. Yeah, you know, and that just don't get helped there because of it. They give up in the end."
379,97,Speaker 1,F,00:45:58,"Well, it's hard as well as the same people who get older. Mm-Hmm. Everything's changing money wise. And COVID hasn't helped because obviously people weren't using cash or weren't accepting cash, so it was all going to be on your card, or whatever. Or you have to go in a bank to organise things, and a lot of people, older people don't work by card but they might find it hard to go on the cash machine and remember what to do to get what they want."
380,98,Speaker 5,F,00:46:37,"And if you're giving your card, if you've got carers coming in to do your shopping for you, then you would have to give them your card and your pin number, which is what you tell them not to do, you know?"
381,99,Speaker 5,F,00:46:52,"Years ago, when you got your pension, you had a book with the, you know, it said what money was due on what date. And that was quite safe because you could give that to a carer and they could only draw that much money out. But now, if you give them your card and your pin number, you don't know whether they need to accept it. They've could taken two lots of £50."
382,100,Speaker 5,F,00:47:16,So you would end up maybe not asking them to get you some food shopping.
383,101,Speaker 4,F,00:47:21,"Well, I think that's particularly relevant if you agree to have your bank statements online. Yeah, I was having out the sense so I can peruse it very carefully."
384,102,Speaker 4,F,00:47:32,"But I like to say it was right. It's like a friend of mine, Joe Drew. I mean, she was the same because she was doing that. But you know, it's not the one that lived in that specific. And then, of course, then when I was away on holiday, she took over the, you know, the cleaning girl. And of course, that was there. The money was just coming out."
385,103,Speaker 4,F,00:47:53,So they don't realise how much money is being spent because they have now.
386,104,Speaker 4,F,00:47:58,They've said that we
387,105,Speaker 4,F,00:47:59,given a five panel and got the change back from it.
388,106,Speaker 4,F,00:48:01,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, you know. Yeah."
389,107,Speaker 4,F,00:48:11,"about about living at home? Yeah, I live on the fourth floor, that's upstairs. There are still I'm done it. So one day in the future, I may find it difficult. Yeah, I'm fine at the moment. Mm-Hmm. I huffed and puffed day on the way up, but you know, I know it could be difficult. Eventually,."
390,108,Speaker 5,F,00:48:38,"When you move into a property, when you're younger, you don't always look ahead. And in 20 years, I'm I going to be going to these stairs, you know, am I going to be able to walk up that hill, which is not what you want to think about? No, you don't. Yeah."
391,109,Speaker 4,F,00:48:52,"So you've got the bath as well. I mean, I've got another bath and a lot of people have to share it, but in the future, you know, I keep thinking about will not be able to get in and out of the bath, you know? Yeah. Yeah, there are all sorts of little things that, you know, like in that picture of the door with the steps going up to it, your steps could be a big problem. They need handrails. There's no apparatus. Yeah, no handrails there. It's no good not that shining floor with the rugs on it. Yeah. And you can't get trapped."
392,110,Speaker 5,F,00:49:29,"You can't get a lot of help with getting adaptations done to your property to help you stay safer. But because older people living longer now, there is a long waiting list for it. So it could be that by the time you've come to the top of the list is that certain adaptation is no longer suitable for you."
393,111,Speaker 1,F,00:49:55,"I did notice as my husband got older, I had to remove all the little the matter in front of the fire. The base trip hazards because."
394,112,Speaker 1,F,00:50:18,"Helpful, what's helpful being in a bungalow or a flat because you don't have the stairs to go upstairs like."
395,113,Speaker 4,F,00:50:39,"I just want the lift for now that you take, you know? Yeah, I've already asked for it."
396,114,Speaker 5,F,00:50:45,"I've got it in advance, I've got written down. There is always the possibility to put one in, you know? Well, did you say"
397,115,Speaker 5,F,00:52:40,"Yeah. See, when I go to dancing, like this morning, I need to wake up at nine o'clock to get to Plympton and I live in the Barbican, but it's just you just don't do that if you want to do things. Yeah, sometimes you've got to just go where it is and where it's, you know, where it's available."
398,116,Speaker 5,F,00:52:59,"No, no. Half of the class do it on Hoe. Yeah. And some of them is up on the hoe and do it up there, which is nice."
399,117,Speaker 3,F,00:53:23,"To look out and see the sea, it's wonderful."
400,118,Speaker 1,F,00:53:25,"Nice parks, places to walk along the sea. It's it's really nice, really. I really appreciate this, it's beautiful. And it is accessible as well."
401,119,Speaker 6,F,00:53:39,"Yeah, I don't thnk that nowadays it's more important that you you go with someone rather than go walk on your own. Yes, I think sometimes it's a bit dangerous walking on your own, but I think you would love to walk. You walk out on your own."
402,120,Speaker 4,F,00:54:00,"I never think about it. I just go, I just do it because it's not at night."
403,121,Speaker 3,F,00:54:06,"But little, Jamie said to me, You know, little jean. Yeah, because sometimes she and I go walk together and she said, it's nice to with somebody because you see different things from when you're with somebody else and it's true. Yeah."
404,122,Speaker 5,F,00:54:36,Flat in Plymouth? Laughs... Plymouth must one of the hilliest place.
405,123,Speaker 1,F,00:54:37,The reason why we live so long is we walk up and down hills so much.
406,124,Speaker 3,F,00:55:00,"Well, it well pavements  much in full. Well, it had its share of terrible losses. You can easily fall down."
407,125,Speaker 7,M,00:55:11,"The only danger I can see is crime. Crime is a lot, isn't it?"
408,126,Speaker 3,F,00:55:24,I'm to kerb cruel and I didn't know whether to be in Sochi because he was a lady of the night on the ground that you still saw. Laughs...
409,127,Speaker 5,F,00:55:33,But you still got it. Don't put that down. Laughs...
410,128,Speaker 1,F,00:55:42,"I think most of us go to things that are put on for the older person that isn't working anymore. That can go to these things like dancing, swimming, exercising. And then you go off to the lectures and have news for you. Yeah, I think there are. There's more of that if you want to. If you can find in our walks created for health reasons, people with health reasons that want to walk and they walk us through the parks and everything, and it's sociable. Yes. So there's a lot to be thankful for that we felt like we found herself and she was lost, laughs... And she makes us do all sorts of things."
411,129,Speaker 5,F,00:56:42,"She kept us going through this lockdown, but soon enough she came on to..."
412,130,Speaker 5,F,00:56:59,"But you still can't have the motivation to go out enjoying them. And there are a lot of old people that have. I've not just got the motivation to go out there and you can tell them about what is going on in the, you know, in the city and what they can join in with. But a lot of it is, I think that when I've been in this long, it won't hurt me, you know, and they just don't feel that they've got confidence to go and catch a bus anywhere and walk into a new road and sometimes there used to be a buddy system. So I think, you know, you do need maybe a buddy to actually get you over that from doorstep and to join in. Mm-Hmm. I mean, as you can see, I think most the group of outgoing he would make of. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whereas if you've been in special through lockdown and how you used to being in doing your own thing, not not communicating much with other people that you just don't, you feel it's too much effort now, so they need to speak like a buddy system somewhere? Mm hmm."
413,131,Speaker 2,F,00:58:07,"And Hazel sometimes, bless her, you're in a meeting or somewhere with her and she'll come up and she'll whisper in your ear: ""can we go and have another word with him?"" and invite him to come and join whatever we're doing and we grab another one, don't we?"
414,132,Speaker 3,F,00:58:26,"Colin, sometimes I'll get into making the first move."
415,133,Speaker 2,F,00:58:28,George as well was going on as Hmm. Took him around the park this morning. Yeah.
416,134,Speaker 5,F,00:58:36,"Even twice. Yes, I did."
417,135,Speaker 3,F,00:58:39,"He took me in there and I took the test. He, suddenly I looked out of the corner of my eye and he was wobbling on his legs. He is over ninety bless him on Tuesday. And I thought, Oh God. And then I looked and I go switching for his puffer. I brought my first state book with me. But when it came round to it, they both said, No, we go round that extra bit as well, and they did. The whole lot would be. So they showed me through my test."
418,136,Speaker 3,F,00:59:12,"Yeah, they do kind of push themselves that little bit more, don't they? rather than give up."
419,137,Speaker 1,F,00:59:21,Coffee morning.
420,138,Speaker 5,F,00:59:24,"Bbut when they say coffee morning, it is in the pub."
421,139,Speaker 2,F,00:59:40,We spend a lot of time on Messenger. We have this spending time and I was on it until now.
422,140,Speaker 6,F,00:59:47,"Well, messages to us for most, not just people, is linked to this Facebook and its Facebook Messenger, isn't it? And messages as well. Yeah, messages. This is WhatsApp. Well, some are using WhatsApp."
423,141,Speaker 2,F,01:00:04,I use WhatsApp but I don't use Facebook or anything.
424,142,Speaker 5,F,01:00:06,You're not missing much when you don't use Facebook.
425,143,Speaker 1,F,01:00:09,"I know who you are, but I'm aware of some of the things I am, but I'm not. Fossil, but with forests in the oceans and the fishing and the palm oil thing, sharing all that, trying to get people to understand what we're all doing. But people get fed up, don't they? to seeing it. It's a fact of life that climate change is the big thing. It always seems to do with it."
426,144,Speaker 6,F,01:00:37,"I've only got one argument that a lot goes through it. I think, yes, I'll sign it. And then it says at the bottom. Donate. I can't  just donate  and I don't donate online anyway. ."
427,145,Speaker 1,F,01:02:22,Just stay in your accommodation.
428,146,Speaker 3,F,01:02:29,"as you know about public transport, access, accessible public transport."
429,147,Speaker 5,F,01:02:44,"It is not only public transport, but there's also something called Access Plymouth, so people can register and then book a trip if you've got to. If you want to go out to say to Taichi and you can't use public transport, you can book Access Plymouth and they will come and pick you up and drop to it and pick who can take you home again. You have to register and register for it. And there is a small fee. Yet you register in advance and then you book it. You've got to give you a couple of days notice. And there is a small fee you get built at the end of the month for it, but there's various things that you can book it for if you want to go shopping and things and. And I think it's run by volunteers, the drivers are. OK, but the ones I've seen I've never used it, once I've seen it always been really helpful."
430,148,Speaker 5,F,01:04:18,"No, I don't think so. Yeah, but you also can use something also use cars as well as mini cars for the minibuses. You know, so if you are a wheelchair user, for example, you could use that. Well, sometimes I'm afraid they will use the car for you."
431,149,Speaker 5,F,01:04:42,"So I think lots of these people live centrally. Don't you? Yeah, we do. You live in Derriford, but I live in Plymstock as well, but everybody else lives centrally rent. And so they won't be looking at the  transport, you know, the public transport."
432,150,Speaker 7,M,01:04:58,They don't have taxis today from community aims to begin
433,151,Speaker 5,F,01:05:01,and you got you got lost. Laughs..
434,152,Speaker 7,M,01:05:03,"No, that wasn't the taxi, that that was a human error."
435,153,Speaker 3,F,01:05:25,We've already said a couple of things. So you want us to pick three things out of them?
436,154,Speaker 3,F,01:05:56,You want three positives and three negatives.
437,155,Speaker 1,F,01:06:04,Transportation is positive. Yeah. So is Messenger really isn't. Yeah.
438,156,Speaker 5,F,01:06:10,Yeah. Access to nature
439,157,Speaker 2,F,01:06:12,access to nature is a blessing.
440,158,Speaker 4,F,01:06:14,Yeah. But you don't want to count. Three Don't. So what else would you say was the involvement then by the.
441,159,Speaker 3,F,01:06:25,"Well, the environment where you live and access to nature."
442,160,Speaker 1,F,01:06:28,"Yeah, yeah, not necessarily one side, but you could be inside no one like outside. Yeah, inside and outside the environment. Yeah. Well, I suppose that access to nature."
443,161,Speaker 1,F,01:07:21,I'm looking for stairs. Stairs is like a very big negative.
444,162,Speaker 2,F,01:07:28,I think how to use technologies.
445,163,Speaker 1,F,01:07:30,"Yes. OK. Yeah. Well, I think it's positive."
446,164,Speaker 2,F,01:07:35,"No, no, it's hard. Well, it's a step in the right way."
447,165,Speaker 4,F,01:08:05,"I mean, you can have your flat, your lift I mean."
448,166,Speaker 2,F,01:08:17,"No, I have to move, I see you do that. Well, that's going to be difficult. You don't want to move, do you?"
449,167,Speaker 1,F,01:08:51,"Stairs and Technology. What else? The trip overs? Well, that's that's all around us in the pavement. Yeah, yeah, but it's a negative thing isn't it? trip over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How many people fall over in the streets do? Yeah, yeah."
450,168,Speaker 5,F,01:09:44,"One of the things is like the internal environment that you live in. Yeah, because what was suitable for you when you moved in is not suitable now, and quite often the properties can't be adapted in any way or suitably for you. So it is moving out of the property living into something else. And you know, as you get older, you don't want to go through all the stuff in the loft. Get somebody elsedo that.Laughs.."
451,169,Speaker 8,M,01:10:49,That's a difficult one.
452,170,Speaker 1,F,01:10:55,Safe environment and messenger.
453,171,Speaker 1,F,01:11:07,"It's inclusive. Is it WhatsApp before it closes the Sharks? Snapchat, Snapchat"
454,172,Speaker 2,F,01:11:18,"Oh, I think that's sensitive. OK, and I can't look."
455,173,Speaker 8,M,01:11:24,"Technology, stairs and trip hazards"
456,174,Speaker 3,F,01:11:56,observations like that about what should I associated with at frustrated
457,175,Speaker 4,F,01:12:40,"Well, upstairs is not accessible rooms."
458,176,Speaker 3,F,01:12:49,"Yeah, exactly. No, no, no. I agree with you. There's focus one, A and B. I mean, Penny was talking about she's she's all right now. She might have to move.But OK, she can move. But then whatever she moves through, she's got to start finding new friends and things."
459,177,Speaker 6,F,01:13:16,"Of course, I haven't got any."
460,178,Speaker 4,F,01:14:02,Air quality. Oh yeah. Like bad air quality.
461,179,Speaker 4,F,01:14:23,Not being able to drive the car at the time.
462,180,Speaker 3,F,01:16:18,"But I think that is negative, isn't it?"
463,181,Speaker 1,F,01:16:21,The attitude that you come across?
464,182,Speaker 1,F,01:16:23,"It appears. Well, I don't think so. I think, you know that someone I think we were talking about all night."
465,183,Speaker 5,F,01:16:55,"Um, well, you know, when we do Taichi, that is attached to something called the Elder tree. OK, that's for like people that they come and see you in your home and things like that befriended, befriended and with the commune in that attitude they go to is Gordon and they've been doing his shopping."
466,184,Speaker 5,F,01:17:14,"Oh, good. Yeah, yeah. The Elder tree and they've been doing Gordon's shopping for it and they do all sorts of things,."
467,185,Speaker 5,F,01:17:36,"There is also silver line, which is another service for older people. So, you know, everybody thinks it's a taxi group in Plympton, but it's actually"
468,186,Speaker 2,F,01:18:49,"well, it's it's a common thing that you see now is ageist. Yeah. And it's the attitude towards older people. You know, where some people can't be bothered explaining things to them or helping them? You know, I'm sure that's different in banks, you know where they help them. But there are some people that just can't be bothered with them because they're older and more wobbly. And, you know, you would think. Well, I think it's just physical as well."
469,187,Speaker 3,F,01:19:29,"Sometimes they don't even notice you're there. They walk through, you're feeling invisible. Yes. Yeah, that's a good one definitely.It just seems strange now when shop assistants called me darling, and are you all right my love, sweetie..laughs. It seems a bit strange. I don't feel that."
470,188,Speaker 1,F,01:20:01,"Mm hmm. Yeah, that's negative, isn't it?"
471,189,Speaker 3,F,01:20:04,"Well, it's kind, isn't it kindly? I don't take offence by it. I just seems..."
472,190,Speaker 2,F,01:20:08,"but people could be offended, couldn't they?"
473,191,Speaker 3,F,01:20:11,"Yeah, yeah. But if they sort of humped and glumped because I was a bit slow putting stuff into my bag, I'd get upset then so I can take that one."
474,192,Speaker 5,F,01:20:22,"Well, I suppose it's a perception of what is an older person. Yeah, if you're 18, anybody over 30."
475,193,Speaker 1,F,01:20:28,"So yeah, yeah. You know? When you get to 70, well, there's no chance you just think, you know, you know, that's it."
476,194,Speaker 3,F,01:20:42,"I'm quite content in my life here, you know?"
477,195,Speaker 3,F,01:20:46,We've got about 30 years.
478,196,Speaker 3,F,01:20:51,They want life to be nice.
479,197,Speaker 5,F,01:20:53,"I don't go back 30 years because I was in a divorce then, I'll go back 25 years."
480,198,Speaker 2,F,01:21:14,"That might put, you know, I might be put off, although I might put them off if I tried to go raving Glastonbury. Oh no, I go to Glastonbury, but no, not at raving, no, no, no."
481,199,Speaker 4,F,01:22:54,"Not really, no."
482,200,Speaker 1,F,01:23:07,"Not in my case, but I suppose in the future mine would be. Carrying shopping up the of all the stairs that's the problem, and if you get it delivered, they don't bring it up the stairs."
483,201,Speaker 4,F,01:24:01,But the taxi driver always brings up. I don't think he likes it. He doesn't get much choice. He just get some shopping
484,202,Speaker 6,F,01:24:18,"And it won't be Morrisons because they put everything in a big plastic basket, not in bags. So they're not going to bring those shopping up the stairs,."
485,203,Speaker 7,M,01:24:32,You've got some undesirable people in our block.
486,204,Speaker 5,F,01:24:34,That's a negative one as well.  the deliveries? Yes. Yeah.
487,205,Speaker 6,F,01:24:57,We should be careful. Yes.
488,206,Speaker 1,F,01:25:03,And that makes their minds.
489,207,Speaker 1,F,01:25:24,"Maybe by that time, Hazel bought you a lift."
490,208,Speaker 2,F,01:25:39,"Well, my family helps me. Yeah, so we put family down. That's a positive."
491,209,Speaker 4,F,01:25:45,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. absolutely, because my daughter ..."
492,210,Speaker 5,F,01:26:36,"Negative! It depends which side you're looking at, that side is nice, and that side is not."
493,211,Speaker 4,F,01:26:40,"Yeah, we've got like good and bad."
494,212,Speaker 5,F,01:26:59,"I think it depends on what kind of property you live in. If you live in a block of flats and you know, several neighbours in that block, officials say there's seven other flats there. Out of those seven, you're going to find a couple that would be helpful. Yeah. You know, but I live on a busy main road and I believe that 32 years and I only know the neighbours of either side because everybody was out and about to work and everything. So I don't really know them."
495,213,Speaker 4,F,01:27:29,"Oh, I was saying about when the weather was really bad. The young man that lives just across the road upstairs from he came down and so did make above me. And then you're not going out with anything you want, will get it for you. Which is lovely and sweet."
496,214,Speaker 1,F,01:27:47,Very nice. isn't it?
497,215,Speaker 2,F,01:29:05,"I think where we live that we fall out occasionally, it's more like a big family. Mm hmm. Yeah. You know, even if you fall out with somebody, if they need help, everybody rush out and."
498,216,Speaker 2,F,01:29:21,"Yes, that particular Barbican community."
499,217,Speaker 6,F,01:29:26,"It's differen from whereI live because all the people in the property I live in are all the same age, you know, so you don't have that makes, and in a way that is a negative thing for me personally. But you know. We're all kind of clumped together because we're getting old."
500,218,Speaker 1,F,01:29:53,"Well, we're the same."
501,219,Speaker 6,F,01:29:55,"Yes, but you do have younger people working."
502,220,Speaker 1,F,01:29:59,Playing loud music and have party.
503,221,Speaker 3,F,01:30:02,Join them. laughs...Yeah.
504,222,Speaker 1,F,01:30:04,Not at one o'clock in the morning. So it could be it could be a negative thing.
505,223,Speaker 5,F,01:30:21,"This morning, I got a Facebook friend request from Young Georgie, so I remember being born to make life above me, and now she's got kids of her own. She wanted me as a Facebook friend. Laughs. That's not bad. I've known since the day she was born."
506,224,Speaker 8,M,01:32:16,"The deliveries, delivery services, as a negative, because they don't bring it all the way up the stairs."
507,225,Speaker 3,F,01:32:26,"Technology is, the fact of the social and gotten social justice. Oh, social and social."
508,226,Speaker 2,F,01:32:45,"Easy access to things, I suppose. When you are older, you know, stais, for example."
509,227,Speaker 1,F,01:33:13,You can write down what you like when we're gone. Laughs.
510,228,Speaker 1,F,01:33:59,So it was this this is all towards. I understood that it was how a robot could help you in.
511,229,Speaker 2,F,01:34:49,We look forward to that.
512,0,Speaker 1,F,00:01:25,You're welcome participation as well. No worries.
513,1,Speaker 2,F,00:03:52,I live on my own.
514,2,Speaker 3,F,00:03:53,I live on my own too
515,3,Speaker 4,F,00:03:55,I live with my partner and my two cats.
516,4,Speaker 5,M,00:03:58,I live with a partner on one cat.
517,5,Speaker 1,F,00:04:02,"I live with my partner, and sadly no, no cat ."
518,6,Speaker 3,F,00:04:52,"Very important. Well, obviously I'm not at home all the time. All. It's my space. It's my home, and I can do anything I want. I don't have to please anyone."
519,7,Speaker 5,M,00:05:11,"Yeah. I don't think I'd mind because if I feel that I need help with somebody around in case something happens to be, I feel bad for somebody with. You know, if that was something someone was knocking every day or checking, if I'm OK."
520,8,Speaker 3,F,00:05:28,My children are always on the phone.
521,9,Speaker 5,M,00:05:30,Are they?
522,10,Speaker 1,F,00:05:30,"Yeah, that's my biggest fear. I don't have children. I don't want to be amongst other people. I want to stay inmy own home, but what happens if Rob is not there like it and I get poorly, I just die in the living room probably. Laughs.."
523,11,Speaker 3,F,00:05:44,"I mean, you know, we're lucky we got intercoms posts in our flat. So if benefit was to happen, we could get straight on a medical. So my hope is that gives me confidence. What my daughter come down for 10 days before it's gone?"
524,12,Speaker 3,F,00:06:02,"She took over my telly, she took over my chair and everything else I don't like. I'm like oh, oh."
525,13,Speaker 1,F,00:06:21,"And also when you've got a lot of people around you that you're not used to having around you, you're like, Oh, I have to dress, I have to brush my hair. I have to be on my best behaviour. I have to be nice to people."
526,14,Speaker 3,F,00:06:33,"You take me up so hard, if you don't like it, bye bye."
527,15,Speaker 2,F,00:06:38,"But let's do it, and I work you from home like we are now, aren't we? It's just very. The only time I actually put all my work clothes is ... Now, obviously we are allowed to go out and do visits again when we were when it was totally working from home. Any time I would actually get dressed, get sort of get dressed, put in a nice top and brush my hair was when we had Zoom meetings. Otherwise, I'll be like... yeah."
528,16,Speaker 5,M,00:07:01,I'm shaving less often.
529,17,Speaker 2,F,00:07:02,"and I keep my pyjamas on, you know it's raining what I want to get dressed for."
530,18,Speaker 3,F,00:07:08,"Because at young age after you spend all your life trying to impress people, you become so many different people's to try to fit in, and you lose your own identity, you know, so I think, well, if you don't like me, so I'm not going to like me if I'm dressed in mine. So, yeah, you know, professional person, they're not going to like me."
531,19,Speaker 2,F,00:07:26,So this is no surprises.
532,20,Speaker 2,F,00:07:32,"When  you're saying about living independently. So I when my two were little, I worked in several different care homes like one was a Devon County care home and it's gone now. It's a 52 bed one. And it was their lounges on three separate floors. Much the same size as six chairs all the way around, and in the corner was like I say, a normal sized TV like we would've had years ago in our own front rooms, not as big as these  even, and people were just staring at that space or nothing in sight. And I would hate the thought that that would ever happen to me. You know, it's just it's horrendous."
533,21,Speaker 1,F,00:08:17,"I don't like the idea of not being able to eat the foods that I want to eat. So somebody is going to come and give me like school dinners, a plate of something that I don't like or don't enjoy. And that's my only choice, especially if I'm in a position where, you know, I'm not well enough to go out and buy food or cook food. So that scares me. The I'll spend the end of my life, you know, just looking at the slop on the plate"
534,22,Speaker 5,M,00:08:41,Tapioca!
535,23,Speaker 2,F,00:08:43,"You can't. Just existing, not doing anything."
536,24,Speaker 1,F,00:08:46,"No joy! Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it takes all the joy out of life is, you know, this is all that's left to me. I don't have to worry about my weight anymore, but look what I've got to eat and that's not very inspiring."
537,25,Speaker 2,F,00:08:57,"Exactly, I want to enjoy my food because ."
538,26,Speaker 1,F,00:09:01,"Yeah, what's left to me?"
539,27,Speaker 2,F,00:09:03,"Yeah, I am not able to walk or anything, but yeah, you just yeah..."
540,28,Speaker 4,F,00:09:08,"I've got got a man living next door to me, he is a hundred and one, and without a support from his family, I don't know, how he would get on because he's slowing down more and more and more is falling over a lot. He sits out to eat his food and everything else. So, you know, see, without  family around. You can be a bit lost."
541,29,Speaker 1,F,00:09:35,Thanks for that sort of thing.
542,30,Speaker 4,F,00:09:37,"I'm sorry, but my family's no good. I'm better off without them. You know, I came out of hospital after an operation and its first time I asked my daughter to come up to look after me and I am the one who has to get up and do the dinner. So what would change? hello."
543,31,Speaker 5,M,00:11:19,"I like gardening, so I'd like green space to look after when I'm older. Feed the birds and stuff like that."
544,32,Speaker 2,F,00:11:34,"So Mary Poppins, I will sing it in my head. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Uh, uh,"
545,33,Speaker 2,F,00:11:52,"uh, exercise. I like to walk in, but obviously I have problems with my legs now. So in ten years time, I don't know. Well, it's my sisters and my mom is the same, so"
546,34,Speaker 1,F,00:12:11,"I'd agree because, as you know, I don't. Yeah, so I want to be able to keep them dancing as long as possible. But also I don't want people to just say, Oh, Hazel, this is your chronological age. So you now have to do seated exercise when you get to do this kind of exercise because they they've seen me on a piece of paper saying that, you know, you may be this age. So they've made an assumption about what I can do physically or not."
547,35,Speaker 2,F,00:12:39,"So they have pigeonholed you. I'd say, Yeah,"
548,36,Speaker 5,M,00:12:45,"Walking, I like countryside walking."
549,37,Speaker 2,F,00:12:51,"and cycling,"
550,38,Speaker 3,F,00:12:53,"I've never been on the bike for years,."
551,39,Speaker 4,F,00:12:54,"I  know, we should go bike riding."
552,40,Speaker 5,M,00:12:57,It's not that flat in Plymouth by the way.
553,41,Speaker 2,F,00:12:59,"Yeah, but you've got electric bikes today, you know, I think it makes it easier."
554,42,Speaker 3,F,00:13:08,"After another 10 years, I might have a scooter."
555,43,Speaker 1,F,00:13:11,"Yeah, you can. Do you miss walking?"
556,44,Speaker 3,F,00:13:15,I used to walk everywhere.
557,45,Speaker 1,F,00:13:16,Do you miss it now that you can't do it? Well.
558,46,Speaker 3,F,00:13:18,"No, I do miss it because I've got this bulges in my spine and the the vertebraes are starting to crumble. And I might get a pinch in my nerve, and my legs just give up and fall to the floor. So I was out with my daughter last week to the Barbican to the Hooe, every five minutes or so, I sit down. And the last two bus stops, I've got a bus I wanted to go home. and I suffered for days after. I don't take painkillers because of if I ever do it and I could, my legs could collapse way with me while I go across the road or anything like that."
559,47,Speaker 2,F,00:13:57,"Yeah, this is kind of masks the real problem, doesn't it?"
560,48,Speaker 3,F,00:14:01,"Yeah, sort of.."
561,49,Speaker 1,F,00:14:04,"I think washing, and that sounds a bit bizarre. But washing and looking after myself, dressing myself, you know, in the future, yeah, feels like a bit of a scary prospect. You know, you got yourself if you've had an operation, you got hit by a car, so you can actually look. And seeing how little it takes for you to not be able to wash or getting out of the bath and, you know, look, look after yourself. You don't think of it when you're well. But as soon as you can't do that.."
562,50,Speaker 4,F,00:14:36,"My mom, she's got diabetes and she goes for dialysis three times a week. She's she's blind, so she she can't cook for herself. My sister's a carer. But she can still shower herself a shower. She can still get herself ready, but she gets so upset because she can't see, so, yeah, yeah, and yeah, so it's really hard for like, see my mom being like family, she was doing everything for me. Now, it's the other way around, but my daughter sees that, you know, like with my grand children, she says, you're wiping their bums. I'll be wiping your bum when we get old. I don't ever want you to do that. She says that to me all the time, I just doesn't say bums."
563,51,Speaker 2,F,00:15:45,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can imagine. What is she looking forward to it or something?"
564,52,Speaker 4,F,00:15:50,"I don't know, laughs. So I don't go to do this, do that, but do that. Can you change Alison's nappy, I don't know. For God's sake, Laura, I'm just want to sit down for two minutes and say this. Don't worry, I'll be doing yours when you get old. I'll be wiping."
565,53,Speaker 2,F,00:16:25,"Oh, bless you."
566,54,Speaker 5,M,00:16:27,I guess it's the mental distress that it causes. Isn't it ? when you can't do what you were used to  maybe ??? with life? Yeah. You know.
567,55,Speaker 4,F,00:16:36,"Yeah, my mom is all like that sometimes, she'd say  I wish I weren't here and she's eighty six this year."
568,56,Speaker 3,F,00:16:48,"When you get to that age, you have to rely on the people you trust, people that are going to look after you. You don't think they're going to abuse you, because in 10 years time I could have Alzheimer's, you know, so you're thinking differently. Yeah, try to trust I mean to trust,  trust people that are coming to look after you, are going to look after you well."
569,57,Speaker 1,F,00:17:06,"And I don't think there's a problem with ... Rayan was just saying you can't do things, but you don't realise you can't do things until you fall off the ladder trying to change the light bulb. Yeah, yeah. You have an accident because you haven't realised that maybe physically you can't do what you always been able to do."
570,58,Speaker 2,F,00:17:25,"So it's kind of a gradual thing, isn't it? Like with your eyesight and your hearing. I mean, my mom's 88 now, and she's always had really good hearing, but I know lately that she'll say, yeah, or she'll think she's answered what I've said, but I know she's not heard me. And yeah, and you think it's because it's not overnight thing unless you have a serious illness"
571,59,Speaker 4,F,00:17:47,"and it's like those things she's always repeating herself. I'll say, yes, mom, you told me the other day, and you know,"
572,60,Speaker 4,F,00:18:06,I look after my grandchildren all the time because my daughter works. So and now it's a six weeks holidays.
573,61,Speaker 2,F,00:18:17,"You're a busy, girl."
574,62,Speaker 4,F,00:18:26,"Yeah, but I've always been a giver. I'm not a taker, so. Me too. Anything you can do to help someone, I will."
575,63,Speaker 2,F,00:18:38,"it's like my next door neighbours through lockdown. The wife has got really serious cancer and treatments doctor in lockdown. And so I did their shopping. I mean, I only ordinarily do shopping once a month, but they like best weekly because it does. So I was coming into Plymouth every week to do the shopping because I had to be in Lidl's, so I held my breath go into Lidl's."
576,64,Speaker 2,F,00:19:05,"Phew! I'm home. So it was really stressful. I don't want to get this disease. Yeah. So that was, you know, it was just nice to be able to do things for them. But then he's a builder. And so he reciprocated by building us a porch, when I gone shopping and you said, Well, you're not going to be there, so I'll go and do your front porch. So I came back and it was almost finished that way. Wow!"
577,65,Speaker 4,F,00:19:33,"So, yeah, yeah, I think, yeah, that scares me having people look after me and not the other way around."
578,66,Speaker 2,F,00:19:45,"Yes, definitely."
579,67,Speaker 1,F,00:19:45,I don't want to be looked after.
580,68,Speaker 2,F,00:19:52,I'm too independent for that.
581,69,Speaker 1,F,00:19:52,And they wouldn't it do it right anyway.
582,70,Speaker 2,F,00:19:52,Of course not.
583,71,Speaker 1,F,00:19:58,Cooking for start. You see it is a theme here.
584,72,Speaker 4,F,00:20:02,"Cooking, cleaning. just do everything that you normally do. That person does, you know,"
585,73,Speaker 1,F,00:20:09,"and you have to be grateful as well. Yeah, which I don't want to be."
586,74,Speaker 1,F,00:20:13,I'm going to be really miserable. Oh yeah.
587,75,Speaker 2,F,00:20:15,But to be beholden to anybody.
588,76,Speaker 1,F,00:20:17,"Because you have to be grateful that somebody is coming and doing it and they have their way of doing it. But you have your way of doing things and it's like, I don't want it, I want it done how I want it, but I'm just going to have to accept. And again, that just adds, and I think I'll probably end up quite low and depressed thinking, Yeah, I didn't have the control of anything."
589,77,Speaker 2,F,00:20:37,"Yeah, you have to compromise all the time, isn't it? Yeah, yeah."
590,78,Speaker 5,M,00:20:40,"And I think it'd be quite nice. I mean, people do things for you."
591,79,Speaker 5,M,00:20:45,"yeah, I won't mind."
592,80,Speaker 1,F,00:20:50,you're quite easygoing.
593,81,Speaker 5,M,00:20:52,I just give them more jobs.
594,82,Speaker 3,F,00:20:57,"Yeah, I still look after my children, even though my eldest is thirty nine next month and my youngest is 31, I still look after them, you know? Mm yeah, it'll be hard. Like I said, Lara said, she's going to be looking after me. That's my eldest. So be hard for me not being able to look after her because I still do."
595,83,Speaker 1,F,00:21:27,What if she moves away? What if she immigrated to Canada?
596,84,Speaker 3,F,00:21:30,She should take me with her
597,85,Speaker 1,F,00:21:32,"What if you were in a position where your children weren't the people caring for you, like strangers?"
598,86,Speaker 3,F,00:21:39,"Yeah, because I've got four children and my girls are here. My boys have moved away. So, yeah,"
599,87,Speaker 1,F,00:21:48,Because not everybody has their family.
600,88,Speaker 3,F,00:21:50,"Yeah, yeah, I know that."
601,89,Speaker 1,F,00:21:51,And not everybody has a family whose wants to or able to look after them. yeah. Hmm.
602,90,Speaker 2,F,00:21:57,"It's about trusting a stranger, isn't it?"
603,91,Speaker 4,F,00:22:00,"??? trust anyone because I've got a life of people all my life and just trust in it takes a long time. I can be with a group of people in the community room, but I don't have to be friends with them, I don't have to associate, I can come straight back into my room."
604,92,Speaker 2,F,00:22:18,"Yeah, that's your sanctuary, isn't it? It's your safe place. Yeah. And yeah, and it's invading your personal space."
605,93,Speaker 4,F,00:22:57,Shopping.
606,94,Speaker 2,F,00:22:58,"Oh, blimey, no!"
607,95,Speaker 4,F,00:23:04,I would go shopping for everyone.
608,96,Speaker 2,F,00:23:11,"See mine is still at the top, like gardening and doing exercise. Yeah, that's really, that's my life."
609,97,Speaker 1,F,00:23:17,"Yeah, mine is dancing because that's all I do outside of work. But equally, I would find it really difficult if I had any visual impairment as I got older because I think there's so much that I do that would be totally different."
610,98,Speaker 1,F,00:23:30,"and I don't know. Obviously, I would learn I would adapt, but I would find that really difficult journey to sight loss. Hearing loss, maybe I could deal with a little bit better, but I would find sight loss a really big issue to deal with."
611,99,Speaker 2,F,00:23:46,"Yeah, ditto because I'm aware, you know, I get dry eyes now all the time and that drives me mad. Yeah. It's not something that they can fix."
612,100,Speaker 4,F,00:24:00,"Yeah, my mom's got that muscular degeneration. So she's not completely blind. It's just a false. And she gets really upset because obviously the past six and a half years I became, I became a granny with my eldest do seven in October, and there is one on the way and every time I go home, I'll take pictures of them. And she gets really upset because she can't see them"
613,101,Speaker 1,F,00:24:30,"But it takes so much away, doesn't it? You can't read, you can't do puzzles, you can't watch films, you can't look at photographs with your loved ones."
614,102,Speaker 4,F,00:24:44,"Yeah, yeah. My mom used to read every night before she went to bed. She has those tapes now. Audio tapes? Yeah. She used to love bingo.  Yeah, she used to be at the bingo five times a week. And she can't. She can't now so ..."
615,103,Speaker 5,M,00:25:11,"Yeah, I've seen it right. I enjoy a good book or good films. I just noticed reading that I really enjoy a good book or watching a good film."
616,104,Speaker 2,F,00:25:24,"Yeah, yeah. I think I like taking photos as well. And so that be hard, you know, you can have the autofocus, but it's nice sometimes to just do it again and due to what you will and I do take photos now without my glasses, but I know it's getting harder. Yeah. And I don't want to have contact lenses to make it easier because I just can't stand the thought of putting something in my eyes. And so even at that, that would be awful if I, you know, so I love walking on the moors to the live on the moors and taking photos to babysit. To have those two things taken away from me."
617,105,Speaker 1,F,00:26:05,"That's a combination of loss, I've lost one thing but it is accurate loss of  ... I like watching people what I like to sit in a coffee shop and watch people and what's going on around me. Because it's sometimes makes me feel less isolated just seeing life around me. But again, if I couldn't do that, yeah,"
618,106,Speaker 2,F,00:26:26,"I know my two. When they were little, we used to make up lives of people doing that. We'd sit and eat. Shall we make up thier lives? What do you think of that? She is a spy? Yeah, well, yeah, right.We give them a really, really interesting lives, they might have them but yeah, so?"
619,107,Speaker 5,M,00:26:44,"Yeah, I'll make rude comment"
620,108,Speaker 2,F,00:26:48,"To yourself, I hope."
621,109,Speaker 4,F,00:27:11,I've got these calls all the time .
622,110,Speaker 5,M,00:27:27,"Yes, yes. You know, regarding the car accident, you had to."
623,111,Speaker 2,F,00:27:31,"Oh, that was 2010. Go away."
624,112,Speaker 5,M,00:27:54,A few of us mentioned walking.
625,113,Speaker 4,F,00:27:58,"yeah, that's one of my hobbies is walking, even though that I can't do. I used to go walking every day."
626,114,Speaker 1,F,00:28:06,"So out of that list walked on the kind of the general. We think of the top three, the."
627,115,Speaker 1,F,00:28:14,"Oh, Yeah. Exercise, yeah. Yeah. So exercise self-care."
628,116,Speaker 4,F,00:28:23,"Watching TV, I love  to sit down and watch TV. Yes, TV, I like all the soaps."
629,117,Speaker 5,M,00:28:38,"Cooking is fun, isn't it? because you can look forward to eating after that."
630,118,Speaker 1,F,00:28:47,Yeah. Depending on your cooking skills. Laughs...
631,119,Speaker 3,F,00:28:56,Probably taking care of myself
632,120,Speaker 2,F,00:28:58,"we've got self care. Yeah. Yes, socialising, because it would be awful to be in a totally isolated, wouldn't it?"
633,121,Speaker 4,F,00:29:24,"See, I like being on my own Sometimes."
634,122,Speaker 5,M,00:29:27,"I think I have it for granted in a way, but it's taken away. Yeah. See if you are alone for the week."
635,123,Speaker 4,F,00:29:34,"Yeah. I go to my church every Sunday, and if it weren't for getting a lift there, I like socialising with them, it's a smaller group and it's more like a family. It's not a great big church and it's nice once a week or we go out for a meal, you know, so there is a certain amount of socialising."
636,124,Speaker 2,F,00:29:56,"Yeah. Just maybe just meeting other people in general in what however, you like to do it. If you know if it's going to the cinema with friends, go for a meal with people"
637,125,Speaker 4,F,00:30:09,in this is like socialisation?
638,126,Speaker 2,F,00:30:14,Even going to work is in a way.
639,127,Speaker 4,F,00:30:21,"I don't mind being on my own but if I was on my own all the time, I wouldn't like it, because obviously I'm busy with my grandchildren and sometimes I just like to be at home on my own doing nothing. But if I didn't have that, I probably wouldn't like it."
640,128,Speaker 1,F,00:30:44,"I mean, obviously during this time, I've talked to a lot of people who do live alone, and maybe the one Zoom call that I do with them a week is the only contact they have."
641,129,Speaker 3,F,00:30:55,"Oh, that's frightening."
642,130,Speaker 1,F,00:30:56,"Yeah. And I think, yeah, when I start thinking about it, it reminds me actually how terrifying that must be, you know, not having any contact andnot being able to speak to anyone. And I think we've all seen it, haven't we? The, you know, an older person at the checkout in a supermarket and just chatting to the cashier. And especially if you're in a rush to get back to work or something or go somewhere, you like the for goodness sake, you know, just move along. But in the back of your mind, you know, that may be the only current contact that person must have. So I think that we can be quite flippant about socialising because we get it. Yeah, yeah. But I can't begin to imagine how how debilitating it is if if literally you get up and there's no one and you go to bed and you've spoken to no one in, that happens day."
643,131,Speaker 1,F,00:31:48,"Also, you may not have the physical ability to get out and meet new people or the confidence to just turn up to something and can't join this club or something that must super frightening."
644,132,Speaker 3,F,00:31:59,"Where I live in community homes. We do take care of each other and the staff family. And if they're not, there is always somebody there if you need. You know, I'm helping people. Yeah, I'm helping people and people will help me. Yeah, it's needed. So you don't see each other for a couple of days before. Oh, and go and look at shopping. So I'm lucky that I'm there."
645,133,Speaker 1,F,00:32:25,"Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I've lived in my house since 1988, and I still don't know the neighbours."
646,134,Speaker 1,F,00:32:33,"Yeah, well, I know them, but we don't talk to each other. Yeah, yeah. I mean, nobody talks to each other at all."
647,135,Speaker 4,F,00:32:39,"Yeah, it's like I live on the Barbican and some of the some of the neighbours are lovely. Others don't even bother with you. You know, I'm always like this: "" Hello, good morning"" but I'm like that."
648,136,Speaker 2,F,00:32:54,"They are looking at you like you're strange. Yeah, yeah."
649,137,Speaker 2,F,00:32:56,"I mean, I think it's the world we're living in now."
650,138,Speaker 4,F,00:32:58,"Yeah, yeah. But like I say, I know a lot of people where I live so, you know, I'm never on my own. and there is always someone there."
651,139,Speaker 2,F,00:33:12,"But now what if I say do, too, and that is the only contact I know we get it a lot. And I know you like your teams, but you were phoning people on their own when, you know, through lockdown. Yeah, and you said the same team."
652,140,Speaker 1,F,00:33:25,Yes. Yes.
653,141,Speaker 1,F,00:33:28,"Um, and we would get leaseholders as well, like I did. We we don't find them like you would for tenants. But you know, when we're speaking with our like more elderly leaseholders, you can't get them off the phone. And it's just they just want to talk and talk. And oh, we really, really something. Don't be sorry. That's fine with us. Somebody else will pick up the phone to somebody else is. You know, it's just ..."
654,142,Speaker 1,F,00:33:51,"And I think sometimes it's not your problems. You don't necessarily want to talk to other people about your problems. But it's when something funny or something really positive has happened to you. You want to share with someone and then it's like, Oh, oh, I can't tell anyone and I've got nobody to tell my good news to, you know, that must be really difficult."
655,143,Speaker 1,F,00:34:12,"And again, I suppose, you know, it's all about being going, losing your eyesight, maybe losing your hearing. Then when you don't have that communication, you know, that must be quite isolating as well."
656,144,Speaker 5,M,00:34:26,"Well, isolation was used in prisons as a punishment, wasn't it?"
657,145,Speaker 5,M,00:34:33,Oh yeah. So you'd be locked on your own.
658,146,Speaker 1,F,00:34:36,"You know, it is still used as a punishment.So that just goes to show that, doesn't it? That's how you punish human beings and actually isolate them. Yeah, yeah."
659,147,Speaker 5,M,00:34:45,"And I think there was a study made by a bit of a cruel statistically, but I think they did it with cats and the cats would be happier if you had any kind of contact, even if it was negative contact if it was just hit. Kind of thing, rather than stroke, it would be happier just because of the contact. So they were saying, well, that could be sort of people as well. Yeah. So just bad, any contact was better than nothing at all which is weird."
660,148,Speaker 5,M,00:35:34,Very important! Laughs..
661,149,Speaker 1,F,00:35:35,Yes. And that's an understatement.
662,150,Speaker 4,F,00:35:38,"I'm an ex smoker and I, you know. But I smoked until just after the pop started to stop you, and I used to be outside every five minutes up in smoke if I. So I do understand when you want a cigarette? Yeah."
663,151,Speaker 2,F,00:36:10,Did they say that all the most important meetings go on in the smoking area?
664,152,Speaker 2,F,00:36:25,All the big decisions are made.
665,153,Speaker 5,M,00:36:28,"Well, that's where you got all the guts??? Said, which is great things you wouldn't say in the office."
666,154,Speaker 2,F,00:36:34,"Yeah, I guess you can just pretend, you know, one of those candy ones we used to have when we were little."
667,155,Speaker 5,M,00:36:46,"And you get to learn about all the teams because suddenly we're going to talk of the other teams in the organisation unless there's a meeting or something or something formal. So, yeah, so you get to know what's happening in their little neck of the woods."
668,156,Speaker 4,F,00:50:15,Oh the worst one is opening a tin
669,157,Speaker 1,F,00:50:19,O Jar Jar. Oh yeah.
670,158,Speaker 3,F,00:50:24,"I think everyone knows what kind of problem. I know, I know. Sometimes, you can get it open easily and other times, it's just won't. Yeah. Yeah. Bang it!"
671,159,Speaker 2,F,00:50:35,"You can get a gadget, though."
672,160,Speaker 5,M,00:50:38,"Yeah, yeah. There's a can opener??? Which is really good. Yeah."
673,161,Speaker 2,F,00:50:41,"My mom's got one to make it easier, but it's knowing that you can get that gadget , that's the thing."
674,162,Speaker 1,F,00:50:49,"So I have very high ceilings in my house they are nine foot tall, so to actually change a light bulb needs a ladder. I also have one light bulb that hangs over the stairwell, which you have to get on top of a ladder. Somebody has to hold your legs and you have to lean over, Oh God, the drop to change the bulb. Oh no. And every time I have to do it, I am so terrified. And that's now. So if that light goes in the future."
675,163,Speaker 2,F,00:51:21,It's going to say dark. Laughs
676,164,Speaker 1,F,00:51:23,but it's the hallway light that lights the whole stairs. So then I would have no light in the stairs.
677,165,Speaker 5,M,00:51:28,You could put the light somewhere else?
678,166,Speaker 1,F,00:51:30,"Well, I I guess if I had the money to have somebody come and, you know, do the job. But yeah, that would need somebody quite... Because it will need scaffolding. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, because it's three floors high and the the one lights on three floors high and literally dangling over and you can see the floor and you're like ...."
679,167,Speaker 4,F,00:52:01,Get them on the wall.
680,168,Speaker 1,F,00:52:03,"Yeah, but I was saying it's going to be quite an expensive job."
681,169,Speaker 2,F,00:52:07,"I think any maintenance issue, isn't it? When you getting older that you can't do it yourself. You know, even like, you know, cleaning the windows outside, I can do it now, but you know, in the future,."
682,170,Speaker 1,F,00:52:20,"And it's that balance, isn't it? between because I think one of the things that worries me about getting older and having a pension is not having enough money because I don't have resources. So if you can't do things for yourself or you have to have adaptations, you have to be able to pay for them. So if I'm on a small pension and I can't afford to pay to have things done in the house repairs or adaptations."
683,171,Speaker 5,M,00:52:49,A lack of money could be a barrier.
684,172,Speaker 4,F,00:52:56,"But I think there are places you can go and they'll come out and do it for you. But you own your own home. So I don't have it works that way. Yeah, but I know people like my sister. She couldn't get in the bath, no more so they came out to put  the shower in, and she's got like a toilet. Yeah. So because she can't, she's on one of those walkers now."
685,173,Speaker 5,M,00:53:23,"You've got to qualify, I think. Yeah. And then social services would help you."
686,174,Speaker 1,F,00:53:29,"Yeah, maybe."
687,175,Speaker 4,F,00:53:29,"That's what I meant, social services."
688,176,Speaker 3,F,00:53:32,All depends how much money you 've got.
689,177,Speaker 1,F,00:53:35,"And how serious your condition is becauseI might feel that my situation is serious, but somebody assessing me in a very formalised way."
690,178,Speaker 1,F,00:53:45,"Social services may say, Oh, we don't think that you're needy enough."
691,179,Speaker 3,F,00:53:50,"Yeah, yeah, I'm going to get a stool to sit on so that I can do peeling vegetables or cooking or anything like that. If I make the bed, I have to stop because of the pain in my back, so that  can take me hours, even put a hoover around. I have to stop, sit down place my back so that can take ages. So actually, I might need a cleaner."
692,180,Speaker 1,F,00:54:13,"Yeah, and that's going to cost you. You know, and you have the resources. Yeah. And then again, that's somebody coming in your home that you might not want."
693,181,Speaker 3,F,00:54:20,"Yeah, yeah."
694,182,Speaker 5,M,00:54:22,"And it's knowing that that help is out there as well, because you may not know that you could get help. Yeah. So it'd be nice if somebody came to see you and explained, Oh yeah, you could have this, you could have that because I'm sure a lot of think lots of older people don't claim certain things today and that they're entitled to."
695,183,Speaker 1,F,00:54:41,"Yeah, yeah. And there is the pride as well, isn't it?"
696,184,Speaker 4,F,00:54:46,"Because my mom was the same. She didn't know she she had a pension, and that was it until she stopped going blind and social service came out, filled all these forms for her. She's getting fortune now."
697,185,Speaker 1,F,00:55:02,"Yeah, but that is depending on somebody letting social services know."
698,186,Speaker 4,F,00:55:08,"And my mom doesn't think that she should be entitled to it now. Well, if you're not entitled to take it off you."
699,187,Speaker 5,M,00:55:18,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, she's paid all her life social insurance. That's what it's for, isn't it?"
700,188,Speaker 4,F,00:55:25,"Yeah, yeah."
701,189,Speaker 1,F,00:55:26,"I think also my house is designed for me at my health and my height and my capabilities. If any of those change, you know, I won't be able to reach the cupboards. I won't be able to get down, you know, if I were in a wheelchair or was having to use sticks to get around things that are simple now. Yeah, you know, would suddenly just be impossible to manage."
702,190,Speaker 2,F,00:55:52,"So I mean, we've only got like a two story and not really high ceilings, but they're coming down the stairs. We've not got banisters because don't need banisters at the moment. And one of I actually. And we've got like one door the front door. To go out of that to get up to the main road to the path  we've about 12 steps. So again, like if I, you know, if my abilities gone. How would I get up those steps. Because you know my next door neighbour, he's got the cancer, her husband, she's got a mobility scooter now. And he took away the steps and put in a ramp. But it's like, Wow, it's a bit steep. I would say, mice, imagine, you know, going down it and disappearing down in the garden. wow..laughs"
703,191,Speaker 2,F,00:56:45,"So it's that, you know, all of that you think, Oh, so you like you can do all of these things now quite easily, but in years to come? Yeah, I saw those in it adapting your home to suit. Yeah."
704,192,Speaker 1,F,00:56:57,"And shopping. You know, obviously, we go shopping. We take the car. If I wanted to get the bus, I would then have to maybe shop small every day because I'd have to walk back from the bus stop, which is close to the house. I wouldn't be able to carry much. And if I got a trolley, I wouldn't be able to lift the trolley onto the bus to get, you know, so I'd constantly be having to think about what do we need? What can I carry? How far do I have to carry aids? What shops can I still use?"
705,193,Speaker 3,F,00:57:28,"And if you're using a walking stick, you've got less."
706,194,Speaker 2,F,00:57:32,"Yeah, yeah. And if you live remotely, sort of away from the city even harder because. You know, if you can't drive anymore. They're not necessarily bus services to where you want to go, when you want to go there. I said that makes it even harder as well. I mean, we've got like one little village shop we sell basic things, but they are expensive. Yeah, exactly. So, you know, like half a dozen eggs is just over two pounds woo. So again, if you want, you know, just a state pension, you know you going to be compromising your health because you you're doing without things. Because, yeah, because of that, you know? Yeah, I save the boiler break down. Heat is more important to you may be than have been a loaf of bread or some milk. I don't know. You know, you've prioritising what you do and don't need, isn't it?"
707,195,Speaker 2,F,00:58:37,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, they were struggling during the pandemic, weren't they?"
708,196,Speaker 4,F,00:58:41,"For me, I like to go shopping myself, I hope not never happens to me because I love shopping."
709,197,Speaker 2,F,00:58:51,"I like I like to my own food. Yes, because my my menu for the however long I've done my shopping is based on what I buy. Yeah. And if so, I'll be getting the bargains. Yes. Yes, special offers. And then that takes what you're making for the rest of the month."
710,198,Speaker 5,M,00:59:08,Especially with clothes because you want to feel them and try them on.
711,199,Speaker 4,F,00:59:11,"Lots of shops have shut down, like Debenhams, I'm gutted because I love that shop."
712,200,Speaker 3,F,00:59:18,"With  home delivery you've got to rely on the products being good, especially fresh products."
713,201,Speaker 4,F,00:59:27,"When you are in the supermarket, you see them going around with these big trollies and they just go on like they're picking it off the shelves."
714,202,Speaker 3,F,00:59:34,"Yeah, I'm checking the day of expiry."
715,203,Speaker 1,F,00:59:37,"I'm too fussy. I'm one of these people that if there's a row of them, it's like not the first one."
716,204,Speaker 1,F,00:59:43,"And yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody's gonna take the first one. I have to get one from around the back. You know, I might go and shop and think I'm going to make beef stew today, and then I go in the shop and something else is more reasonable, or catches my eyes. So yeah,"
717,205,Speaker 2,F,00:59:59,"yeah, it's exactly what I do."
718,206,Speaker 5,M,01:00:03,Look for the bargains.
719,207,Speaker 2,F,01:00:04,"Yeah, yeah, it's what it's sort of"
720,208,Speaker 4,F,01:00:06,"clearance. I like to look at bargains. Yeah, yeah. Well, I buy some good stuff."
721,209,Speaker 3,F,01:00:14,"You can put it in the freezer, can't you?"
722,210,Speaker 1,F,01:00:16,"Yeah, I have had deliveries before, and what I found difficult is the guy comes to the door and dumps it down on the floor. And then you know that he's on a really short timescale. You know, he's got to turn around in so many seconds and and he's kind of like, you know, get your and get your shopping and you're like, Oh, really stressed that I'm going to kind of like yank everything out of this thing, and I wouldn't like somebody to come into the house and be just chucking stuff. Yeah, and then rushing off. So yeah, I don't know."
723,211,Speaker 5,M,01:00:48,They don't always give you the very thing either.
724,212,Speaker 1,F,01:00:50,"Yeah, we've given you this instead. Did I ask for that? No. Why are you giving me that?  How is that helpful?"
725,213,Speaker 5,M,01:00:55,"It's the same colour..Laughs.  Yeah, yeah."
726,214,Speaker 1,F,01:01:07,"Also, I think food shopping is quite personal, isn't it? Yeah."
727,215,Speaker 3,F,01:01:11,And it's another way of socialising. You get to see people.
728,216,Speaker 4,F,01:01:14,"Yeah, but the thing is, if you live on your own, you've got to spend a certain amount for it to be delivered."
729,217,Speaker 4,F,01:01:22,Yeah. So get five over twenty five or whatever.
730,218,Speaker 4,F,01:01:26,"Yeah, well, yes, that's right. I was born out of food and you're not going to necessarily be using that. Yeah. Have you ever looked in somebody else's shopping basket or trolley and been quite judgemental umm? Laughs"
731,219,Speaker 4,F,01:01:38,Yeah.
732,220,Speaker 1,F,01:01:40,"And sometimes if I've got something in my shop, I always feel guilty. If I'm buying a bottle of wine, you know, my local co-op, I was like,"
733,221,Speaker 2,F,01:01:46,Does anybody know?
734,222,Speaker 1,F,01:01:47,Yeah. And then I think I want to hold it up and go low alcohol. Laughs
735,223,Speaker 2,F,01:01:51,"Okay, maybe. It's eight o'clock in the morning and I need it...Laughs"
736,224,Speaker 5,M,01:02:57,"Yes. Knowledge. Would it be big for me? Knowledge knowing? Yeah, yeah. Information?"
737,225,Speaker 5,M,01:03:04,Yeah. So it's something you haven't heard about
738,226,Speaker 2,F,01:03:13,"I think everybody would have internet, wouldn't they? I keep saying that in our village when the like the parish council say well they can find on the web pages, maybe they don't use internet. Yeah, yeah."
739,227,Speaker 4,F,01:03:24,"Yeah, I mean, like, are we talking about when we are going to be that age where I know how to do the internet, but I'm not great at it. I get by. But like, like my mother, she's in her 80s. She's blind. She does know nothing. We bought a mobile phone. She couldn't use it!"
740,228,Speaker 4,F,01:03:49,It's worth some help as well. Yeah. Asking somebody.
741,229,Speaker 1,F,01:03:52,"So that's about socialisation, isn't it?"
742,230,Speaker 3,F,01:03:53,"Yes, for the knowledge somebody that's using whatever. It's like a social service or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. So something would know, if they're using their facilities.."
743,231,Speaker 5,M,01:04:07,something like 65.
744,232,Speaker 2,F,01:04:08,It's like a community group .
745,233,Speaker 1,F,01:04:12,"So, you're looking for the physical things, you know?"
746,234,Speaker 1,F,01:04:19,"So for me, I don't know about other people, but for me, one of the big problems is the actual physicality of the house that I live in. Keeping it in good repair and suitable for me."
747,235,Speaker 2,F,01:04:31,"Yeah, maintenance."
748,236,Speaker 1,F,01:04:32,"So I don't know how to describe that. But yeah, and maintenance and adaptations for the property that I'm actually living in."
749,237,Speaker 2,F,01:04:40,"Yes, do you need help getting in and out of the bath and up the stairs?"
750,238,Speaker 2,F,01:04:58,"It could be, couldn't it?"
751,239,Speaker 1,F,01:05:10,Did we say much about transport as well?
752,240,Speaker 2,F,01:05:17,"We did mention it. Yeah, sort of loss the car, so you got loss of independence. If you ..."
753,241,Speaker 5,M,01:05:22,Transport.
754,242,Speaker 1,F,01:05:23,"Yeah, mm."
755,243,Speaker 3,F,01:05:33,I think knowledge.
756,244,Speaker 1,F,01:05:35,"I don't think that's a physical one, isn't it?"
757,245,Speaker 5,M,01:05:38,"Oh, I see."
758,246,Speaker 3,F,01:05:39,All right.
759,247,Speaker 1,F,01:05:39,"I think that's more like a social informational one, I think we are thinking about, you know, kind of bricks and mortar type of .., you know, the physical environment around us"
760,248,Speaker 4,F,01:05:49,"Being able to do your own shopping, if you couldn't do your own shopping. That's a big one for me."
761,249,Speaker 2,F,01:06:05,That you're physically being able to go and do it yourself.
762,250,Speaker 6,M,01:06:08,"Maybe the mobility? Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. Like, moving yourself and also transporting things. So it's more like for mobility. Yeah. Yeah."
763,251,Speaker 1,F,01:06:24,"Yeah, so it's a physical capability."
764,252,Speaker 6,M,01:06:27,"Yeah, something like this. I loved the whole knowledge that you guys talked about because this is something that's not exactly physical. It doesn't fit anywhere, but it's just amazing. And I think that that's something we need to think about."
765,253,Speaker 1,F,01:06:43,"And maybe it's something more like run regular newsletters, regular updates, community centres which are very physical in the sense of, if those if those people like us actually community workers, age concern. Yeah, yeah, you know, housing provider,."
766,254,Speaker 3,F,01:07:02,They would know a lot of...
767,255,Speaker 1,F,01:07:05,The kind of the physical environment if those agencies like.
768,256,Speaker 6,M,01:07:10,An information centre.
769,257,Speaker 2,F,01:07:12,"It's like the GP surgeries, they know the demographics to be able to..."
770,258,Speaker 5,M,01:07:26,"Because it's always something you learn like, Oh, I didn't know. But even now in my job and I should know what's out there, mostly. But that's always something I think I've got to know about that."
771,259,Speaker 2,F,01:07:36,"And if that makes your life easier by knowing it, that you know that you could get sort of grab handles to get the door, you know, if you were struggling with your front door would, you know it's just yeah."
772,260,Speaker 3,F,01:07:50,I think information is important because there's a lady that moved into the wrong house and she realised that the heating was in with the bill.
773,261,Speaker 1,F,01:07:59,Oh bless her!
774,262,Speaker 3,F,01:07:59,"So she was freezing cold all through the winter. She had to go to hospital for hypothermia. You know, she was really in a bad way because she didn't get information"
775,263,Speaker 1,F,01:08:10,and she was frightened to put it on?
776,264,Speaker 3,F,01:08:12,"Yeah, because it was extra money, she didn't realise. So that's why I'm talking about, information ...I told her go and ask in the end."
777,265,Speaker 1,F,01:08:32,"But we all obviously ...yeah, we didn't do a good job by explaining that that to her. Obviously, and again, I guess.."
778,266,Speaker 3,F,01:08:40,"It's also the maintenance of the House isn't it? yeah, because keeping it warm."
779,267,Speaker 1,F,01:09:23,So helpful gadgets. I love a gadget.
780,268,Speaker 3,F,01:09:31,"Did you meet my sister when she came down? Um yeah. She she got loads of stuff because obviously from the hospital, all the doctors, you know, she got a social worker to come to see her, and that's how she found out. She got lots of stuff."
781,269,Speaker 1,F,01:09:52,"Yeah, so gadgets, adaptations for actually physically help you stay in the same environment"
782,270,Speaker 4,F,01:09:59,"and help keep your independence, doesn't it? Yeah."
783,271,Speaker 1,F,01:10:04,"And having a handrail for up, yeah, versus moving home. Yeah, such a quick win."
784,272,Speaker 3,F,01:10:10,"I've got all that in my flat already. Because the person who lived there before me was in a wheelchair, so ..."
785,273,Speaker 1,F,01:10:28,"Cats, yes. Love cats."
786,274,Speaker 3,F,01:10:30,"They're dangerous when you get older, trip over. My one sent me down the stairs because you know when you go down stairs I don't go straight I go like this. I tried to avoid him, top to bottom, boom. Oh, so that's why my back is..."
787,275,Speaker 1,F,01:10:46,Did you get rid of your cat after that?
788,276,Speaker 3,F,01:10:49,"No, no. Laughs"
789,277,Speaker 1,F,01:10:50,See because you love your cat.
790,278,Speaker 5,M,01:10:51,"They are company, aren't they?"
791,279,Speaker 1,F,01:10:53,"and they that they are the best company. Yeah, yeah."
792,280,Speaker 1,F,01:11:00,"And I found after my cat died that I felt that I had nothing to care for and no routine in my life left because it was like I would get all she would be where is my breakfast. Hmm. So I had that routine of. And it kind of took me out of me because I had to do something for something else. You know, I had to always be thinking of something something else. You know, and there was a company routine. That sense of"
793,281,Speaker 5,M,01:11:32,something to worry about.
794,282,Speaker 1,F,01:11:33,"Yes, yes, exactly. So I found it really hard when she died because I just felt like the house felt like a house not a home and I felt like something was really missing. And I really struggled to to find a routine or something to do that wasn't just about me. Yeah."
795,283,Speaker 5,M,01:11:53,When did she die?
796,284,Speaker 1,F,01:11:56,November.
797,285,Speaker 5,M,01:11:57,Oh yeah. Are you going to get another one?
798,286,Speaker 1,F,01:12:00,"I want to. But Rob is not ready yet. He says, .."
799,287,Speaker 5,M,01:12:05,Just take on home.
800,288,Speaker 3,F,01:12:07,Yeah. We will get you a little kitten.
801,289,Speaker 3,F,01:12:09,and that's what I want to get a kitten.
802,290,Speaker 3,F,01:12:12,"Yeah. Well, I'm not one allowed the pets, so yeah, but I wouldn't have another pet."
803,291,Speaker 1,F,01:12:17,And I think that's really difficult..
804,292,Speaker 3,F,01:12:19,Because it's tying as well.
805,293,Speaker 4,F,01:12:21,"You can go on birthday now, you can go away. You haven't got to worry about somebody looking after that more."
806,294,Speaker 3,F,01:12:29,That's the problem I had when I moved to the Barbican.
807,295,Speaker 3,F,01:12:35,"Well, yeah. But yeah, they are too tying, I mean, because my mother's not well and it's hard. To get up there when you have to, but I've got good neighbours who look look after her."
808,296,Speaker 1,F,01:12:52,"Yeah, but I think again, pets may become more important when you can't go long distances you when maybe you're not travelling. So much and you know you're on your own for longer periods of time."
809,297,Speaker 3,F,01:13:06,"I'm just waiting when Kirsty gets home, she's getting a dog, so I'll dog sit my grand-dog. Yeah, Liam's got born. But obviously he's up in Manchester."
810,298,Speaker 3,F,01:13:29,"Another one is stairs lift, because a lot of people live in two story house or whatever, so stair lift would be a physical adaptation. Would it be in the mobility, stairs lift? because it is mobile, to take you upstairs and bring you down."
811,299,Speaker 5,M,01:13:56,"Yeah, it comes with adaptations."
812,300,Speaker 6,M,01:13:59,"It's a very broad categories, so..."
813,301,Speaker 1,F,01:14:02,"But I'm thinking that pets are very important to people. Certainly would be, it would get more and more important."
814,302,Speaker 4,F,01:14:10,"Yeah. And dogs, dogs and cats, they sense when you're unhappy, so"
815,303,Speaker 1,F,01:14:21,"And a cat says I don't care. Yeah, you're unhappy, oh yeah, whatever."
816,304,Speaker 3,F,01:14:30,Dogs are more reliant on the owners and cats are more dependent on us.
817,305,Speaker 1,F,01:14:36,"And I suppose if you have something like a dog, as long as you don't have a massive great big dog, then that feeds into the exercise, you've got a rason to go out to push yourself to exercise."
818,306,Speaker 3,F,01:14:56,"Yeah, that's right. Spaces, parks. Yeah, yeah. Lots of well-being, isn't it?"
819,307,Speaker 4,F,01:15:01,"Yeah. Well, I live on the Barbican, so I've got everything there, green space, the sea, rubbish, too, Yeah, seagulls. Laughs"
820,308,Speaker 5,M,01:15:16,"no. It's nice down there, isn't it?"
821,309,Speaker 3,F,01:16:14,"The other thing is, I find supermarkets don't cater of single people. So you have to buy big, don't you? I don't need to buy big tins, I want small tins. So tomatoes and things like that. So it's not necessarily catered for single people."
822,310,Speaker 4,F,01:16:35,"Yeah, you can. You can buy small tins, but sometimes it's cheaper to buy a big tin, though."
823,311,Speaker 1,F,01:16:47,"But if you go to somewhere, like if you go on holiday and you, you go to a restaurant and it's just you. Yeah, it's a very uncomfortable experience to sit in a coffee shop by yourself. Yeah. To sit in a restaurant. Oh yes. But I think it would be much know. I know some restaurants tried this. This is a table where somebody might come and say, I can't remember the expression, but somebody might come and sit and chat. And so I'm."
824,312,Speaker 6,M,01:17:14,Is it a shared table  or something like that? I don't know.
825,313,Speaker 1,F,01:17:16,"Yeah, it was a scheme and there was a notice on the table and it said something like this is a community coffee table and somebody might just come. And if you sit here, be prepared. Somebody else might come and sit here with you to chat. And I think there needs to be more of that kind of thing because if you don't get to see anybody, and you think well, I'll go out for a cup of coffee. You then feel like a good drinking go or I've got to pretend that I'm reading something because I'm"
826,314,Speaker 3,F,01:17:41,"The times I had to go and get something to eat, it's like.... so it would be nice just to"
827,315,Speaker 1,F,01:17:51,"Especially again, if it's difficult to cook at home for yourself, you don't feel like it to be able to go to places where you didn't. You didn't have this feeling that everybody was going, Oh no, no. Oh dear, on our own."
828,316,Speaker 3,F,01:18:08,"Also, I think as you get older, it's harder to make friends. Yes. Yeah, because your old friends, you know, might moved away or they passed away. Yeah, and all that sort of things. So, yeah, well, to make new friends, it's quite hard."
829,317,Speaker 4,F,01:18:24,"You know, I left my home, my family, my friends, over 30 years ago and when me and my ex-husband split up and moved to Plymouth and. Because my daughter was here, obviously, my eldest daughter was here already. And, um, yeah, I find it really, really hard. I was in my forties when I moved into Plymouth, and I did find it really, really hard considering I had a lot of friends in the army environment. It was just like a big family. And so I left home, moved to that. All my friends are in Sutherland, my best friends, the people I grew up with, family also."
830,318,Speaker 1,F,01:19:15,"I think also if you lose a partner, with a divorce or they die, then you often lose half of your friends with that, you know, because."
831,319,Speaker 4,F,01:19:27,You lose half of the family.
832,320,Speaker 1,F,01:19:29,"Yeah. You know, you might as a couple. Yeah, their family. Yeah, you have their friends as well. Yeah. And that person isn't there for whatever reason. You suddenly just what? It might include things like grandchildren and things."
833,321,Speaker 4,F,01:19:42,"Yeah, yeah. My, you know, his for his family were very supportive of me. We were really, really close. But now, like the kids have got their own kids. So basically all I see is, well, I've got friends. Hazel's my friend. Yeah. Not that you've seen much of each other. I haven't. I've got my family. But sometimes it's just nice to."
834,322,Speaker 5,M,01:20:20,"I was going to say often it's we compared to China you know, where the culture is different, where the elderly are more respected. I mean, we don't live in the same house. Yeah, there is more social connections. Well, in Britain, we've lost a lot of that in the last century, I think."
835,323,Speaker 3,F,01:20:39,"Yeah, because of the care home system as well."
836,324,Speaker 4,F,01:20:43,"Yeah, I do see my family there. They would be there for me to drop of the heart if I needed them, but I need them to meet me. Yeah."
837,325,Speaker 1,F,01:20:54,"So, I don't have any family left living. So, it's me, that's the end. But I think there's a lot of prejudice about older people. You know, there's a lot of assumptions about older people about, you know, for example, if I'm putting on an activity and somebody saying I'll put some music on and they say we can find some war songs and I'm like, How old do you think these people are?"
838,326,Speaker 1,F,01:21:19,"Oh, you know, yeah. Laughs. They were probably in the teens listening to this stuff in the sixties. Yeah, yeah. There's this idea that once you hit 50, you know you want to talk about the war. You want to, you knind of..."
839,327,Speaker 3,F,01:21:36,mention Elvis Presley. You say ...Laughs
840,328,Speaker 1,F,01:21:41,"you know,and because you've hit a certain age certainly, physically you've deteriorated, mentally  you've deteriorated, and"
841,329,Speaker 4,F,01:21:48,"all my children were brought up listening to Disco. I love Disco, but my grandchildren, then probably one they'll grow up, I don't probably think..., it's horrible music. I mean, some of the music my children like, I like, you know,."
842,330,Speaker 1,F,01:22:10,"But you're not allowed to. Do you know what I mean? In the sense? Yeah, because you're older. Yeah, yeah. You're not allowed to like that music or you're not allowed to like these clothes, you know, why are you shopping in that shop buying those clothes? You should be down at Marks and Spencers? buying something suitable for your age."
843,331,Speaker 5,M,01:22:35,"It's kind of interesting stuff, you know, you just got to try  once you're older, you know, like, you know, well, maybe somebody younger. Yeah. So maybe not so valued."
844,332,Speaker 3,F,01:22:49,"Yeah, I think when I was young, the eldest was the boss and all that changed in that quite annoys me. Yeah, yeah, that is right. Yes."
845,333,Speaker 1,F,01:23:01,"That is interesting that you say that, you know, because as you get older, you find that the people who are telling you what to do at work, are actually quite a lot younger than you. And you're like, ummm! Laughs"
846,334,Speaker 3,F,01:23:13,"Oh, yeah, you know, I even now I respect my mother, you know, if she says, you do this, you do it. Yeah. But now it's like. So it's just I mean, I know I'm only 61 year old, but it is like losing control. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The kids rule the roost, not the adults."
847,335,Speaker 5,M,01:23:42,You need to put your foot down.
848,336,Speaker 3,F,01:23:43,"I know, I know ..Laughs."
849,337,Speaker 3,F,01:23:43,"The other thing I find is I'm not good on technology. I'm not there at all. I don't just let it go. Yeah. And you're trying to ask your daughter, Tell me, why do you do it yourself? Try it yourself. Yeah. You know, that's it."
850,338,Speaker 3,F,01:24:02,"That's that's another thing. It's a barrier. Yeah. I think to older people, it's a technology thing. I think it's sleeping us the airlines. Yeah. You know, banking is going to be online. All this sort of stuff now going to be everything. Yeah. And also the other thing you know, you can get done on the phone at a certain age, you know.."
851,339,Speaker 3,F,01:24:26,"Rotten phone calls, you know, trying to get money out"
852,340,Speaker 1,F,01:24:29,"Oh, scammers?"
853,341,Speaker 3,F,01:24:30,"Yes, scammers, that sort of things. So you don't understand that. I think that's enough environmental problem."
854,342,Speaker 5,M,01:24:36,"Because it's a big social thing with Facebook and stuff now. Yeah, yeah."
855,343,Speaker 3,F,01:24:40,"Because nobody properly talks to each other anymore, do they? That's always on the phone. Yeah. You know, so you can say nasty things to people that you don't see their feelings? Hmm. Face to face. So you could get all that as well. So that could terrify an old person, you know?"
856,344,Speaker 1,F,01:24:57,"Yeah, I get the other thing, because I'm quite OK with technology. Yeah, I was in a coffee shop one day, it seems to spend an awful lot on coffee shops, and the app wasn't working. And I said to the go at the counter, Oh, I can't get my points. The app isn't working and she said you have to have the app and I'm like, I've got the app. Do you know how it works? My love and I'm like what? Why do you talk ...Of course it's just not working. And it was because she saw that I was older. My hair was grey. She immediately assumed, that I didn't know how to use the app. No, it's just not working. It's not that I don't know how to use it."
857,345,Speaker 3,F,01:25:39,"Yeah, to me Hazel, you look really young, you know,."
858,346,Speaker 1,F,01:25:43,"Oh, thank you."
859,347,Speaker 3,F,01:25:43,"But I've said that to you in the past,."
860,348,Speaker 1,F,01:25:45,And maybe I was having a bad day. Laughs.
861,349,Speaker 1,F,01:25:49,"Yes, she was, exactly. Really condescending. She was raising her voice. She was speaking very clearly ..."
862,350,Speaker 1,F,01:26:05,"I think I found it quite upsetting because it reminded me that I am to other people what I see is not what other people see. And there was this assumption that I might end up missing out on things or being treated in a different way because people have made a judgement about me. Just, you know, we've decided that you're an old person and you're not capable. So we're not going to even offer you this opportunity to do something."
863,351,Speaker 3,F,01:26:35,"When I get on the bus with a younger person, gets up, sit down, Idon't want to sit down and stand up here. Laugh."
864,352,Speaker 4,F,01:26:46,"I still get up for an eldery person to give them my seat. But you see these people come and just sat there and an old lady over old man gets on and the won't move. Yeah, and there is me getting up."
865,353,Speaker 1,F,01:27:07,"But it's in the media, isn't it? If somebody either in the negative, they get attacked in the street or, you know, somebody does something. They run a marathon. If it's somebody under the age of 50, they just run a marathon and they just got mugged. Once you pass 50s, they deal, you know, 73 got mugged. Or, you know, amazing man. 81 run a marathon. It's like this whole thing in our culture."
866,354,Speaker 3,F,01:27:35,"Yeah, I've been mugged. It's not nice."
867,355,Speaker 1,F,01:27:36,"No I know I can imagine that, you know, people have this perception without really thinking about what people are like at certain age."
868,356,Speaker 3,F,01:27:46,That could not give confidence.
869,357,Speaker 1,F,01:27:48,"Exactly. And and then that makes you start thinking, do I need to be, you know, in a more supported environment? Am I safe? Do I want to go out? yeah."
870,358,Speaker 1,F,01:28:01,"Yeah, very frightening!"
871,359,Speaker 4,F,01:28:24,"Plymouth community homes are brilliant. Yes, they are. You know, you can't fault them, even though sometimes some certain people put them down. Mentioning no names Hazel, you probably know who I am talking about. But yeah, they are really good."
872,360,Speaker 3,F,01:28:52,"The person, the person who wants to know without asking? Because if you don't ask, you're not going to learn. Yeah, yeah. But if they don't know the people, they're not going to help you. Yeah. So it's down to the person or the family. Yeah."
873,361,Speaker 4,F,01:29:08,"Yeah, I think because you get to when you first move in you get a booklet, all the dos, the don'ts, the waht's on. Yeah, I think that's really helpful. Yeah, but I reckon this lady didn't know she should have been told that because when I moved in then told me, well, when I went to look at the property then told me everything that I have to pay. Yeah. And what the payment was for. Yeah. So I can't understand why that lady wasn't told."
874,362,Speaker 4,F,01:29:45,Yeah. So why would she sit in the cold?
875,363,Speaker 5,M,01:29:48,"Unless she missed it, you know, because you are told so many things anyway and you can't remember everything."
876,364,Speaker 3,F,01:29:57,"yeah, yeah, because you're new to the place you're frightened. I suppose you'd get worried to ask other people, you don't know them. Yeah. And everything else. Yeah. You know,."
877,365,Speaker 1,F,01:30:05,Why would she sit in the cold?
878,366,Speaker 3,F,01:30:07,"I thought had her cover over, but still not enough, because she had not wanted to come out with us either?"
879,367,Speaker 3,F,01:30:12,"Yeah. You know, so her blood blood was low, but I don't know why."
880,368,Speaker 4,F,01:30:17,People would they put the heating on. I can't understand why she wouldn't put the heating on.
881,369,Speaker 3,F,01:30:21,"No, because she thought she had to pay extra on top of it."
882,370,Speaker 4,F,01:30:25,"Oh, I see."
883,371,Speaker 3,F,01:30:26,"She wasn't told the heating was included. She wasn't told, so she thought she had to pay extra on top to keep the place warm."
884,372,Speaker 5,M,01:30:38,"I'm thinking about social groups as well as clubs, and there is like something holding people back like all that's not for me. Oh, that's not my kind of thing. Well, in fact, if you were to go along with it, make new friends and probably have a laugh. Yeah, and it would be generally, good, good for them. So I think people should be encouraged to do more."
885,373,Speaker 1,F,01:31:01,"And also maybe some more things where people are encouraged to mix through ages. Yeah, because, you know, some intergenerational stuff where we're and I don't mean that patronising thing where very young people come with a basket of food..."
886,374,Speaker 3,F,01:31:16,"I love mixing with the elderly, even though I'm"
887,375,Speaker 1,F,01:31:19,"yeah, but I think we should do things like lunch clubs that have a whole, you know, anybody is welcome to come, because I think once you start saying this is for you because you're a certain age and you go to this and you don't go to the that again just reinforces a lot of this kind of ."
888,376,Speaker 5,M,01:31:36,"It is creating the family, I suppose, isn't it?"
889,377,Speaker 1,F,01:31:38,Yeah. Absolutely.
890,378,Speaker 3,F,01:31:39,"I think we are lucky ourselves for the generation we're in now, because 60, 20 years ago, would be the old age, wouldn't it? You know, we're talking about sixty looking after older people. Yeah, it seems weird, you know? Yeah, I'm scrapping at 60, all those years back. So we're lucky because we've got the infrastructure, the free national health and all sort of things which they wouldn't have, you know, so we are lucky that way, and that's why I think we're living longer. So there is more for us, yeah, than it was in the past. You know, there were care homes in those days"
891,379,Speaker 4,F,01:32:18,"But th thing in the past, everything was, it's like, you know, this plastic pollution? Yeah. You know, you never got anything in plastic bags when I was young. Everything was in paper bags."
892,380,Speaker 4,F,01:32:32,"Yeah, I used to get grease proof paper to wrap your ham and then put it in a brown paper bag. Yeah. So now, more stuff I know, they're trying to stop that, but that was in my generation."
893,381,Speaker 1,F,01:32:57,"And that is definitely a physical barrier. Yeah, yeah. Plastic packaging on some fruits these days. When you're trying to pull it off, and it just won't go ."
894,382,Speaker 3,F,01:33:01,"Especially with the arthritis in your hands, right?"
895,383,Speaker 1,F,01:33:09,"Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty funny. Put it back in paper bags please."
896,384,Speaker 5,M,01:33:12,Like the TV is a big social friend for people as well.
897,385,Speaker 4,F,01:33:17,"I wouldn't, I couldn't live without a telly."
898,386,Speaker 1,F,01:33:20,"So when you say TV, do you mean like the regular channels or do you mean like things like Netflix, prime?"
899,387,Speaker 5,M,01:33:27,"Whatever people can access, I guess. Yeah, but it's like a friend in the corner, isn't it? yeah. Keep it coming."
900,388,Speaker 4,F,01:33:32,"It's a it's a noise. Yeah. Well, even if you're not really taking in, it's the noise in the background. I was talking,"
901,389,Speaker 1,F,01:33:38,"Yeah, my tell is on all the time. Yeah, watching it. That's just going on news just in the background."
902,390,Speaker 5,M,01:33:46,What was that Gogglebox?
903,391,Speaker 1,F,01:33:48,"Oh, that's so funny."
904,392,Speaker 5,M,01:33:49,"When I watch someone, I feel as if I'm there with them, in the chats as it were, so it's like, Oh, they're my friends. So it's kind of like a social contact in a way. Yeah, it's weird."
905,393,Speaker 3,F,01:34:13,We've got staff. We've got staff. We can get in contact with.
906,394,Speaker 4,F,01:34:18,"My children, Yeah, because obviously I haven't got that."
907,395,Speaker 3,F,01:34:22,"I've got only one child in Plymouth, my other two are in London."
908,396,Speaker 4,F,01:34:25,"Yeah, I've got two daughters, so my daughters and I think when I get old, I'll have my granddaughters as well. So if my daughters can't do it my granddaughters will do it all of this,."
909,397,Speaker 1,F,01:34:39,"So, if Rob wasn't there, I'd have no one at all."
910,398,Speaker 3,F,01:34:42,You got me here.
911,399,Speaker 1,F,01:34:44,"Yeah, I'll ring you up. I would say, Come Christine and help me."
912,400,Speaker 3,F,01:34:48,"Yeah, as I said, where we are. Everybody keeps an eye out for everyone else so that simply not what we'd knock on the door. You know, so."
913,401,Speaker 4,F,01:34:58,"You know, some people don't want to make friends. Don't want to get on with the neighbours. Hmm. So but, where I live, all my friends, all in the 70s, most of them are"
914,402,Speaker 3,F,01:35:12,Yeah. So you can really rely on the younger generation to look after us when we get older. Yeah. Yeah.
915,403,Speaker 4,F,01:35:20,I know my children will be there for me. Yeah.
916,404,Speaker 1,F,01:35:23,"So have the people enjoyed doing the Zoom and message calls, you know, the video calls?"
917,405,Speaker 4,F,01:35:28,Yeah. I did.
918,406,Speaker 5,M,01:35:30,I prefer face to face.
919,407,Speaker 3,F,01:35:31,"Yes. Yeah, I do. Yeah, in a group like this, it's lovely."
920,408,Speaker 1,F,01:35:33,Is that because you prefer face to face generally or because you find the technology aggravating?
921,409,Speaker 3,F,01:35:41,"No, I I find it rude sometimes."
922,410,Speaker 5,M,01:35:43,"Hmm. I don't know, the interaction isn't as fluid. Yeah, no."
923,411,Speaker 3,F,01:35:49,"I just got a little while. My tablet like that, this little screen."
924,412,Speaker 5,M,01:35:56,I don't mind it.
925,413,Speaker 1,F,01:35:58,"Because I found I actually really loved the first lockdown because there was so much online that I would never, ever have been able to access before. It was just like Aladdin's cave for me. Just being able to to go online and people were teaching things, giving away, you know, content with so much going on that you could get involved."
926,414,Speaker 5,M,01:36:25,"Well, I got some Facebook. I've never would have otherwise."
927,415,Speaker 1,F,01:36:28,"No, no, you wouldn't."
928,416,Speaker 5,M,01:36:29,"Because I'm a bit phobic of technology,"
929,417,Speaker 1,F,01:36:32,"I did dance classes with people in Australia. Last week, I did a ballet class at the Royal Ballet School. You know, I never, ever. I take weekly lessons with a lady in London, and I'm just about to start taking weekly lessons with the guy in Washington."
930,418,Speaker 5,M,01:36:49,What's the topic?
931,419,Speaker 1,F,01:36:53,"Ballet classes in Washington, D.C."
932,420,Speaker 5,M,01:36:57,Have you got a bar?
933,421,Speaker 1,F,01:36:57,"Yes, I have got a bar. Yeah, yeah, I've got a bar. But no, I don't have a mirror. I don't want a mirror."
934,422,Speaker 1,F,01:37:13,"But we also we've got a social group with a group of dancers in Germany where they have the floods. Oh yeah, a couple of weeks ago in Koblenz. And so, you know, we were able to kind of check that those ladies were OK and give them a bit of support and encouraging them."
935,423,Speaker 3,F,01:37:29,"Yeah. But when you get when you get older as well, your eyesight is not so good you could have cataracts or whatever. This order is going to be not good. So we need to hear people. Don't you to talk?"
936,424,Speaker 1,F,01:37:44,"But hopefully, medicine is advancing as much technologically wise as as everything else. Hopefully, by the time we have cataracts, it will be this afternoon having cataracts done and off you pop."
937,425,Speaker 4,F,01:37:59,Hopefully.
938,426,Speaker 1,F,01:37:59,I will ever hopefully.
939,427,Speaker 3,F,01:38:03,"Well, I hope I won't get what my mum's got, macular degeneration. She'll never be able to see again. No, she can see. But she had a cataracts off. That was really the won't take them off until they're deep. Yeah."
940,428,Speaker 1,F,01:38:20,"So I'm hoping to be like Steve Austin, the six Million Dollar Man. I'll just have them replaced."
941,429,Speaker 3,F,01:38:38,"She had a cataract off, and she can see close. Everything was black before she got this cataract  gone, off a few weeks ago, and she can see colours now. So I think she's it's still like fuzzy."
942,430,Speaker 1,F,01:38:52,"That is a little bit of a worry. You know, will the National Health Service still be here? Yeah. Well, we're older, you know? You know, that's a that's a scary thing because I've I've only known the health service, you know, and I've, I've, you know, benefited."
943,431,Speaker 3,F,01:39:13,"My my sister's a carer, but she's up in Sunderland up in the Northeast. And obviously, I live here now, so I don't take her. But I speak to her most of the time and I speak to her every day. If I'm home but if I'm at my daughters, which is a lot. I spend half of my time at my daughter. But yeah, yeah, no, I'm not a carer. Yeah, it's like being a mother again."
944,432,Speaker 1,F,01:39:47,"Yeah. You mentioned something earlier about dementia. Yeah. And saying that, you know, if you've got dementia again, all of this is going to go is going to go is going to go, you've lost. Yeah. That's what all of your social connections, because unfortunately, you know, mentally, you're not able to ..."
945,433,Speaker 4,F,01:40:06,"your memory is not that good either. So you could have to rely on somebody that's just said to be able to go online for banking and everything else. And if we can't go online, then we're in trouble, you know?"
946,434,Speaker 4,F,01:40:36,"Yes, family."
947,435,Speaker 5,M,01:40:39,"Family is a support, yeah"
948,436,Speaker 4,F,01:40:39,"Yeah, well, I've got my church family. So they would be called family."
949,437,Speaker 1,F,01:40:45,"Yes, firends, family. so I guess family in the widest sense. Yes."
950,438,Speaker 4,F,01:40:49,"Yes, because you can choose your friends. Yes, yes. Friends can become family."
951,439,Speaker 1,F,01:40:54,People you are most close to
952,440,Speaker 5,M,01:40:55,Social Connections.
953,441,Speaker 5,M,01:41:07,"Yeah, OK. I think technology, TV and social media are the big one."
954,442,Speaker 5,M,01:41:17,because we I think people watch tons of TV.
955,443,Speaker 4,F,01:41:21,"Yeah, I do. Laughs watching too much.."
956,444,Speaker 4,F,01:41:41,"Yeah, I find it fabulous. There is  these quizzes and all that sort of things, and it keeps working on. Yeah. And everything else. I think that's the physical aspect of it."
957,445,Speaker 1,F,01:41:56,"But like you said earlier, I think there's that sense of if you're in the house with no sound of any description or you feel lonely. Yeah, even if you've got the television on the radio or something, on the background, you don't notice the silence. You don't noticeit by yourself."
958,446,Speaker 3,F,01:42:10,"And I keep talking about my mother, for she likes to how, even though she can't see it, she likes to have the quizzes on. Yeah, you know, she watches the chase. Yeah. And what's the one before that, Tipping point? Yeah. And then so she can answer the questions yes, it keeps up the mind active. Even though she can't see it, she can hear it."
959,447,Speaker 1,F,01:42:39,"So we didn't really talk much about that kind of mental stimulation, did we? That is really important."
960,448,Speaker 5,M,01:42:56,"What about mental health in terms of if you're going physically going worse, you feel bad in your head. Yes. And then you don't feel like going out to meeting people."
961,449,Speaker 3,F,01:43:09,"Yeah, because that could be depressing. When you can't get up and do things for yourself, like you used to"
962,450,Speaker 5,M,01:43:15,When we can't be bothered to go to the church. You know what you're feeling?
963,451,Speaker 4,F,01:43:20,depression.
