0,4,Speaker 3,F,00:02:13,"Would you want to go into the, you know, bottom line, you wanted that you want to live on your place and do things in your own time?"
1,8,Speaker 3,F,00:03:40,It drives them nuts within a week.
2,9,Speaker 3,F,00:04:02,Freedom.
3,10,Speaker 3,F,00:04:03,"Yeah, freedom."
4,12,Speaker 5,F,00:04:09,"Yeah, yeah. You guys have got memories. I mean, looking at a piece of furniture remembering. As a partner, we used to sit in that chair for example. But when you go into these homes, I don't think you're able to take very much with you at all apart from your clothes. All right. That's my understanding. I think"
5,14,Speaker 3,F,00:08:07,"Well, this picture?"
6,16,Speaker 3,F,00:08:37,"Get in and out of bed. Well,  just living. It's not an activity, it's just existing. In fact, it's very sensitive to me at the moment because I'm fighting for some way of being able in and out of bed. And it's happening to have a sleep in the chair. And then because they can't find"
7,17,Speaker 3,F,00:09:05,It's not even mobility is just some sort of equipment and means that I don't have to have a carer coming to put me in and out of bed. so if we are getting emotional it's a bit too ...
8,28,Speaker 3,F,00:14:08,"Yeah, well, not at the moment, but stairs, perhaps at some point in the future."
9,29,Speaker 3,F,00:14:17,"Yes. Well, also outside the house is two dozen stairs up from the road to the house, so maybe I'll have to move at some point."
10,34,Speaker 5,F,00:15:53,"Yeah, yeah, no. I'm sure I could go all the way to Bodmin to do a wee, awfull."
11,37,Speaker 3,F,00:17:00,"without it through your lockdown, you wouldn't have seen anybody that didn't have no children with anybody who didn't have that. You're isolated you"
12,39,Speaker 3,F,00:17:12,"I mean, I think the said, I know it's unusual that the pandemic will take the effect on mental health as being. Of jobs,"
13,44,Speaker 3,F,00:20:04,"You know, I was very, very lucky at the very beginning. I had a heart bypass and my daughter took me up to Kent to stay with her. Unfortunately, not going to school. I was there, so she got stuck with me for three weeks, unfortunately. And you know, any excuse because they brought me back in time or had my first job in Kent and they brought me back to have a second one here. Uh huh.. I must be horrible. Well, it doesn't bother me. I mean, where I live, we don't have a community centre. We don't have anywhere we can go and talk. So I was in the courtroom every day, but I just didn't"
14,45,Speaker 3,F,00:20:59,"day. Yeah. Well, I'm lucky I live on the Hoe. Oh, so I've only I've only got to walk five minutes. I'm actually on the Hoe a life long live every day for a little walk and talk again. I mean, I used to see some of the neighbours, but. You know, we didn't mix."
15,46,Speaker 5,F,00:21:20,"is the ones that couldn't get out in the community. I mean, there's the bungalows and we could see if we couldn't meet up with them and it was fun to see people there was certain neighbours that we had couldn't leave home. I don't blame them. And it could be that. And I love the interaction of people. But without Zoom and teams and all that, I well, I would recommend. Definitely. I mean, I wouldn't have been able to see my family without the internet."
16,47,Speaker 3,F,00:21:53,I haven't got the internet or and I don't use the computer now just it doesn't bother me from the get go and don't bother me when I have to contact firms and they
17,48,Speaker 5,F,00:22:11,"or doctors. Doctors, now that they are nightmares now because I'm trying to get hold on to an e-consult and if you're not on the internet now, for your prescriptions and contacting doctors. That is huge!"
18,49,Speaker 5,F,00:22:27,"yeah. Well, there again, I'm very lucky because when I want my prescription, I'll just bring up a little chemist in West Hoe and they they just routinely get it and they deliver it to me."
19,50,Speaker 3,F,00:22:41,I hope they are not going to stopping that.
20,51,Speaker 5,F,00:22:43,"Yeah, I'm very lucky."
21,53,Speaker 3,F,00:23:13,How did you set that up?
22,55,Speaker 3,F,00:23:35,My surgery will let you know what.
23,57,Speaker 3,F,00:23:55,And also this kind of forgotten health care.
24,59,Speaker 3,F,00:24:03,"Well, how can they see what you look like? It's only telephone."
25,60,Speaker 5,F,00:24:08,"Yeah, that's my issue."
26,63,Speaker 3,F,00:24:36,"Well, I was just thinking of touch wood how fortunate I am at the moment. I did have a partner who has a lot of difficulties that you seem to have. Yeah, you make a good point. Most of your doctors, but all sort of organisations I wanted to get in touch about my television license. And there's no number to ring them. Very annoying. And yet I've done so well."
27,64,Speaker 6,F,00:25:16,"You know, I mean, I tried to ring with William, and I try to ring them the other day, and I didn't find a number, My grand daughter found it on the computer and I rang them. Oh, you've come to the wrong place, you should go for hero."
28,66,Speaker 6,F,00:25:33,"Yeah, yeah."
29,69,Speaker 5,F,00:27:10,"unless there is a  danger now if you were not switched on to the scam, they'll go and say, Oh, something with your back press one. As soon as you press one."
30,71,Speaker 5,F,00:27:23,"And you do it automatically like the something with the police and comics, as you know in the show. Yeah. They will panic, you know, at the moment of screen time, and I don't think so. And. But I would think you'd be lucky, he said, just don't don't don't engage conversation with people. But people do! yeah, and they get caught and they lose an awful amount of money. There's people out there, though this is awful, awful evil creatures that know it. And again, just because everything is online or on the phone. That's how you get people's lives in danger for all this technology"
31,83,Speaker 6,F,00:31:11,"A little bit of back, some decent television."
32,90,Speaker 3,F,00:34:04,So it is both
33,95,Speaker 6,F,00:35:41,"Well, the way I've been thinking. I'm sorry and everything things down because I'm so used to doing it. It seems to be self-care, social interaction, and I guess it's not so magical. So it's self-care. And that breaks up into all sorts of activities, social interaction and medical and financial. Accessing those."
34,96,Speaker 5,F,00:36:11,You're good.
35,98,Speaker 6,F,00:36:35,"exactly what is it? See, I use 40 words but two would do. Yeah, yeah."
36,99,Speaker 3,F,00:36:41,All the different activities tells us that it's totally those
37,101,Speaker 5,F,00:36:57,"But this session don't, isn't it?"
38,103,Speaker 3,F,00:37:19,"with it, isn't it? Two things of the three important things is some of the things you want to do, but there's some things you have to do of those, those three, all the activities you have to do. You have to look after yourself. What was the middle name again?"
39,104,Speaker 3,F,00:37:35,"So social, interactive. Yeah, your health and well-being is included in your social and stuff."
40,105,Speaker 6,F,00:37:47,"Because there was no idea. OK. She's not confused. I'm lucky because all I do is to jump on the bus and go into town do some shopping there is this. I was used to thinking of reserves with that stuff. Yeah, yeah. Tuesdays I used to go for lunch at the church in Glenfield. That's yeah. Well, now I make myself go into water for a walk on the road or catch the bus in the town."
41,106,Speaker 5,F,00:38:17,"and it's important. Yeah, if you talk about what's in the three top important things it's important to and yeah, I think I just think you're good."
42,109,Speaker 5,F,00:39:23,"Um, with transport going on that, yeah, I'm limited."
43,111,Speaker 5,F,00:39:28,"Yeah, yeah. But I mean, I'm pretty nifty getting on and off both the load, the ramp and stuff. Yeah, crashed of the south on the bus that we gloss over that. But it would be here if it's not on the bus route. There's only a certain type of taxi. I can have a map, but you probably yeah, it comes back to transport. It is huge."
44,117,Speaker 6,F,00:41:08,"way they can let you know I'll meet someone who's I've been down to the Did you come from home? Yeah, I'm going"
45,118,Speaker 6,F,00:41:17,"to say this about the guide dogs. All that because the guide dogs go by what they can hear. Yeah, yeah. So it's really massive. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
46,119,Speaker 3,F,00:42:11,It's not been introduced.
47,120,Speaker 5,F,00:42:14,"No, I know"
48,121,Speaker 3,F,00:42:15,what it's
49,122,Speaker 3,F,00:42:16,"like coming otherwise three three years in this place. But in the Pines University here, 50 years ago, it's never, never"
50,123,Speaker 3,F,00:42:26,"been a polytechnic. Yes. Yeah, I think so. She's very down. That's all you need to know. Oh, yeah, yeah."
51,127,Speaker 5,F,00:53:25,"Oh yes, totally."
52,132,Speaker 3,F,00:54:16,"Well, I think everyone was horrified."
53,134,Speaker 3,F,00:54:28,We were worried about what's coming out of the Blue Submarine.
54,142,Speaker 5,F,00:56:39,"of these cars. Driverless cars? Yeah. But you know, there's not a lot goes wrong with the mechanics of the computer. Who do you blame in? And I think both someone killed recently."
55,143,Speaker 5,F,00:56:53,"Yeah, that was yes. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. I wouldn't know. Did frighten me. Right? The Wi-Fi goes down. You go, Okay,."
56,145,Speaker 5,F,00:57:27,How did you get on doing that? Because they tried me with it?
57,147,Speaker 5,F,00:57:34,I wrote off the gearbox.
58,149,Speaker 5,F,00:58:53,"Well, what they did with me because I can drive by right next. I can swap to. So the process was 19. Yeah. And occasionally the automatic. What do you do? I panicked because it took me straight out into the main road which I did think it was stupid. Yeah. And so I was I was I was nervous, so it didn't make any sense. What don't you do with an automatic car?"
59,150,Speaker 5,F,00:59:21,"Yeah, I've done my right leg suddenly burst into life, I suppose."
60,152,Speaker 5,F,00:59:36,"Into face to face, so to drive. But yeah,"
61,155,Speaker 5,F,01:00:43,"I can't drive now, it's one of the drive and you just really. Quite dangerous. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am not supposed to drive anyway."
62,162,Speaker 5,F,01:04:49,People are supposed to deliver houses and so they don't do well.
63,164,Speaker 5,F,01:05:38,"Well, what about this is the percentage of buildings with these thermal cups? Yeah, you can get some of them is what we're trying to do is say thank you can how even though the sort of thing and bring your own drink, you know how it's going to work because honestly, I'm just like, I just manage, yeah. And if I go to shows and stuff, oh, well, we're going to try and find to have those cardboard trays thinking about it so we can help people."
64,166,Speaker 5,F,01:06:15,"Oh, have you?"
65,170,Speaker 5,F,01:09:31,"I think I have made my kitchen was not there. So I think that the wheelchair in the house is one thing. But if you will, in the future, going to have to have mobility equipment like I have a walker as well a space around and that you the units and of that can be dropped if you like can be lowered and which might have been so I can sit in the wheelchair does under certain types of kitchen things that my oven I can't have one with the dropped down door , it's not safe for me, but I have one of those those sliding they are brilliant. So that's socially but not so you can just explain it is cheap, and."
66,172,Speaker 5,F,01:10:29,"Have you ever seen bake off the bake off it, right? What they do, but be put an oven door down what it does disappears underneath it slides underneath.Yeah, because I can't have anything in front of me. I've got to be able to be right in front of the oven book because it slides on. I think it's called Hide and Slide or something like that."
67,174,Speaker 5,F,01:10:51,"And it's it's excellent for that unless you hang on to it. If you try to move on, it goes and slides and, you know, expect it will go on the issue. But the other thing is, what about that? But it's it's brilliant for that because I can go in front and in the wheelchair, sometimes not too heavy. I go to the side. So the kitchen equipment, I think, and otherwise I wouldn't use the oven. It's as simple as that and it's got to be easily accessible."
68,175,Speaker 5,F,01:11:37,"If you look in technology and internet stuff it's kind of sounds awful generations come and go as they age, they will be brought up with this man. It's the wall of the rest of us. So the older ones now generation today, the generation that the older generation that I'm no longer the older again generation, maybe that has never used the internet and are still frightened of it, but that will adapto us, yeah, but as the years go on. Sounds awful. As the new generations come up they will, they will embrace all of this. And which we maybe not"
69,178,Speaker 5,F,01:13:30,But it's not what it's about. Why would you have to if you're doing enough to meet your needs? That's what it's about.
70,182,Speaker 3,F,01:15:10,"You know, so if it's like you say, it's what you said, so you need to give it. You want older people to embrace it as because they don't need it, make it easier. Make it less scary. Yeah, they get that. Sometimes these iPhones. I mean, I love it. I'm a geek. Yeah. As soon as therie is a new technology I want it! But I'm lucky enough to become A.. I've got friends that was so, you know, can't understand it. The technical wording is too difficult if you make it simple wording. Yet I just say press number one press number two fine. Why would you just interface? You know this? I love it, but I don't understand a lot of it. Make it easy. We want older people or people who are scared of it to to embrace the technology. Make it every dayable. Yeah, if that makes sense. Right?"
71,187,Speaker 5,F,01:17:50,"Don't you find it like your eyes on ebay, as you said, Oh, there's marvellous tablet! It should be £700 for £200 if you think you're going to get the genuine thing £200..."
72,192,Speaker 5,F,01:19:12,"So I've got bars all around my house, even if that's possible, because when I go home, I've tried to make myself show for like four stuff stuff. Yeah, I think wherever I put my hand and, well, I set up. That's why we need your help when you come in the hole every everywhere around the world. So do not think you should design. So let's make it open. Right. But I'm going to go around the outside world. Yeah, because everybody everywhere I put my hand, I need a handrail. Yeah, there's basic, that's not technology, that's just"
73,195,Speaker 5,F,01:21:16,"So you've got stairless, haven't you? It is not the one that goes up to the floor. And I think we have seen that. We've got that. Yeah. So it goes, that is lovely."
74,197,Speaker 6,F,01:21:46,"Look by my own house, yeah, so."
75,199,Speaker 3,F,01:21:55,The one I'm thinking about to move back to the stairs up on the outside is a public footpath. Uh-Huh. Yeah. So that's a different part.
76,200,Speaker 5,F,01:22:07,"We couldn't adapt where I used to be. I have what I have now because some of those that go through the others say that the future builds. It's already in place and things, but it's not like they can't be adapted. So this oh we need it to be installed."
77,208,Speaker 3,F,01:24:11,"I am about to have the bathroom changed because it's something I physically need. Yeah, and you said about being able to stay where I am. Yes, if I get worse, then the equipment that's being fitted, it can be again. I think this phrase know it's coming from a future group. They can adjust it so I can stay where I am, so I'm going to need. It's probably at some stage a way of showering and this new equipment can't be and have an add on so I can stay where I won't need help to be showered. So I'm keeping into handles. So that's important"
78,209,Speaker 3,F,01:25:04,"it will be based solely on this idea of being checked being built next week, and it's the hardest part of the electric service and Flamingo is once that's done and it looks perfectly normal. But if I get worse, they can adjust they can block put something onto that'll  help me, which again is thinking ahead."
79,211,Speaker 3,F,01:25:29,"Yeah, thinking ahead. Yes, these things are built and put in it's thinkable ok. What like Bath? Possibly what you're saying? What do we need to put in now just in case? Yeah, I don't know if you understand."
80,212,Speaker 3,F,01:26:00,Sorry.
81,213,Speaker 5,F,01:26:07,"It's lucky that you live where you are, where I am. I'm coming down my bedroom world and I have for 12 months and I've been trying to get it. I have reported it and they keep saying Yes, yes, we'll do it. I've had scaffolding outside my flat for about 14 months. Nothing to do with me. It was a flat blow that took them a long time to cure their down. Yeah, when I said, Well, why can't you expand it because it sounds like no, why can't you expand it? Oh, no, all the scaffolding has got to come down and we'll just build a separate little one for you. Oh, how stupid! The scaffolding came down last week, but I don't know where I'm going to get mine. They are all removed."
82,214,Speaker 5,F,01:27:03,"It's not mould, it is just the black strips."
83,216,Speaker 5,F,01:27:09,"Yeah, and I have this severe case where and oh yes, it is definitely damp. It needs to be done. It's coming through the outside cladding."
84,217,Speaker 3,F,01:27:16,"Yeah, but it could spot, I think, what you're saying. It could be that if you go too bad, they have to say yes, it's not suitable for it to stay. Yeah. So they need to put it right."
85,219,Speaker 6,F,01:27:35,Do you pay rent ?
86,220,Speaker 3,F,01:27:37,"No, it's my own flat, but we're going to come on those factory housing."
87,222,Speaker 3,F,01:27:50,"Uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
88,228,Speaker 6,F,01:28:59,"Yes, absolutely. I suppose we're looking at, we get a bus every half an hour."
89,232,Speaker 6,F,01:29:48,there aren't the amount of seats on the blue buses downstairs.
90,234,Speaker 6,F,01:29:54,"I mean, you see people that are able to stand but they're still using seats. Yeah, yeah, that's interesting."
91,237,Speaker 5,F,01:30:22,"Yeah, I have to ask, what does Pepper think? Because his head is this is kind of, you know, he's looking down"
92,239,Speaker 5,F,01:30:48,"It just gives you a right look, and .."
93,240,Speaker 3,F,01:31:31,"Oh, I think the facilitators is accessibility and that covers what you were saying about accessibility, and that's allowing for people like Gaynor to stay where she is, and she has to be able to use and things like that. And it's making it technology accessible as well. Mm hmm. So it's fair to say the barriers is the inaccessibility to those things."
94,241,Speaker 3,F,01:32:19,"I love what you say about the house. Is that the future proofed? Yes. Yeah. We want more of that because we are an ageing population. Yeah. Yeah, we."
95,242,Speaker 5,F,01:32:33,"It's already in place, we keep coming back to this thing, but it's you're off."
96,243,Speaker 6,F,01:32:39,"You might also make one comment about the accessibility and I mean, I know this room because the astronomical society used to meet in this room and I belong to that we had a long time, but it just doesn't seem to be a hearing in this room."
97,245,Speaker 5,F,01:33:08,Absolutely right. I noticed that. Yeah.
98,246,Speaker 6,F,01:33:11,"But I mean, simple people in here were wearing hearing aids. But there isn't any hearing loop here.  A hearing loop is something that you  fix in the room, it's not difficult, you put wires all around the room. We have one in the church, and so people with wearing hearing aids, they can set their hearing aid to the new system and then they can hear it might be worth mentioning this to university."
99,248,Speaker 6,F,01:34:47,"to him just yet. Yes, you should be like in our church yet we're hearing aids. And she said it's the hidden disability, and she wear them for the service and as soon as the service was out, she's taken them off and goes,"
100,250,Speaker 6,F,01:35:07,"but they don't have a lot of patience with usual deaf. with blind people she can always... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
101,252,Speaker 6,F,01:35:30,"or speak more slowly. Yeah, I mean, I'm finding that with the telephone. You know, these companies occasionaly rang, and I get blown and I say, please start again slowly."
102,253,Speaker 3,F,01:35:41,"Yeah, yeah, I'm lucky with my phone, I press on something and then it comes out very loud,."
103,254,Speaker 6,F,01:35:49,"But OK, so OK, you have used technology to help you."
104,256,Speaker 3,F,01:38:34,Yes. Yes.
105,257,Speaker 5,F,01:38:36,"I just said about physical places. And I have to say it's a criticism of the university. Where I live my home, I can only live one door away because threshold strips. Mm. Yeah. And I'm talkative I couldn't get out of the kitchen,  because the designers need to think, of, this is my soapbox. There are too many able bodied designers designing for disabled people. Yeah, they need to sit in a wheelchair and go round themselves. So that's just my soapbox that it might be. What I have come today. I had a real struggle to find somewhere to get to get in and to come out of the and the Cafe out the cafe. Yeah. You get to live with that. Yeah, yeah."
106,259,Speaker 5,F,01:39:51,"A  big thing for yourself, I'm looking at the factors you're looking at, for me to stay there what was said to me recently? It's all right. The fire brigade will get you just get over the threshold to stand outside. So that way gonna happen. It's something that I'm fighting at the minute. Yeah, it's a big issue. And it might has been adapted for me, both ongoing and there's a few blows. This is the same. It's not only once inside, it's getting in and out, which is also an issue, and you've got stairs and stuff and something you can't get out it's something you never get over. But whereas I would have thought reasonable to adapt or to adjust, and that is a reason to stay where if I would have to move, I'm lucky it can be done. But there are places if you want to stay in your own home, there has to be a way of making from this part of accessibility not only in where you live, getting in and I'm sure that that makes sense."
107,260,Speaker 5,F,01:41:22,"I'm working on this at the minute,"
108,263,Speaker 5,F,01:42:10,"That's well, first, that comes back to self-care, but well to tell you when someone says the word, isn't it? You go, Oh yes, to stay where I am, if I have a problem, if I do well enough to comfort me, rock, as you say, get to know me. If I fall there is a technology, I can get home. But without that, you didn't have somebody like that who taught me that's have to go the care home."
109,265,Speaker 5,F,01:42:47,"It's not too bad. It's not cheap, I used to pay."
110,268,Speaker 5,F,01:43:34,"My hob, every ring on my hob I can set a timer on and it would go off."
111,270,Speaker 5,F,01:44:24,"Why if every time I've put something on the hob, but if I have to leave the kitchen, and the chance of that cliff, would you not believe it?
